In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally, we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. **************** For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to: http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nih-common-fund/epigenomics-data-access-policies ****************"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE16256GSE17312	BI Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project	"The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium aims to produce a public resource of epigenomic maps for stem cells and primary ex vivo tissues selected to represent the normal counterparts of tissues and organ systems frequently involved in human disease.

However, we have uncovered here an inter-chromosomal network connecting active loci enriched in circadian genes to repressed lamina-associated domains (LADs). The interactome is regulated by PARP1 and its co-factor, CTCF, which not only mediate chromatin fiber interactions, but also promote the recruitment of circadian genes to the lamina. Synchronization of circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CTCF interactions, which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina, followed by the acquisition of repressive H3K9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation. Furthermore, depletion of H3K9me2/3, inhibition of PARP activity by Olaparib or down-regulation of PARP1 or CTCF expression counteracts both recruitment to the envelope and circadian transcription. PARP1- and CTCF-regulated contacts between circadian loci and the repressive chromatin environment at the lamina thus mediate circadian transcriptional plasticity."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE26880GSE27452	Genome-wide maps of polyadenylation sites in control and PABPN1kd cells	"We applied deep-sequencing based technique, 3'-Seq, to obtain comprehansive maps of poly-A sites in human cells. 3'-Seq was applied to two cell lines (U2OS and RPE-1), in control and PABPN1 knockdown cells"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE27452GSE29282	A Hybrid Mechanism of Action for BCL6 in B Cells Defined by Formation of Functionally Distinct Complexes at Enhancers and Promoters	"BCL6 is crucial for B-cell activation and lymphomagenesis. We used integrative genomics to explore BCL6 mechanism in normal and malignant B-cells. Surprisingly, BCL6 assembled distinct complexes at enhancers vs. promoters. At enhancers BCL6 preferentially recruited SMRT, which mediated H3K27 deacetylation through HDAC3, antagonized p300 activity and repressed transcription, but without decommissioning enhancers. This provides a biochemical basis for toggling enhancers from the active to poised state. Virtually all SMRT was bound with BCL6 suggesting that in B-cells BCL6 uniquely sequesters SMRT from other factors. In promoters BCL6 preferentially recruited BCOR, but most potently repressed promoters where it formed a distinctive ternary complex with SMRT and BCOR. Promoter repression was associated with decreased H3K36me3, H3K79me2 and Pol II elongation, linking BCL6 to transcriptional pausing."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE29282GSE29943	"Unstressed HeLa cells and ELAVL1/HuR knock down conditions: polyA RNA-Seq, small RNA-Seq, and PAR-CLIP"	"Post-transcriptional gene regulation relies on hundreds of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) but the function of most RBPs is unknown. The human RBP HuR/ELAVL1 is a conserved mRNA stability regulator. We used PAR-CLIP, a method based on RNA-protein crosslinking, to identify transcriptome wide ~26,000 HuR binding sites. These sites were on average highly conserved, enriched for HuR binding motifs and mainly located in 3' untranslated regions. Surprisingly, many sites were intronic, implicating HuR in splicing. Upon HuR knock down, mRNA levels and protein synthesis of thousands of target genes was down regulated, validating functionality. HuR and miRNA binding sites tended to reside nearby but generally did not overlap. Additionally, HuR knock down triggered strong and specific up regulation of miR-7. In summary, we identified thousands of direct and functional HuR targets, found a human miRNA controlled by HuR, and propose a role for HuR in splicing."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE29943GSE30017	Widespread regulated alternative splicing of single codons accelerates proteome evolution	"Thousands of human genes contain introns ending in NAGNAG motifs (N any nucleotide), where both NAGs can function as 3' splice sites, yielding isoforms differing by inclusion/exclusion of just three bases. However, the functional importance of NAGNAG alternative splicing is highly controversial. Using very deep RNA-Seq data from sixteen human and eight mouse tissues, we found that approximately half of alternatively spliced NAGNAGs undergo tissue-specific regulation and that regulated events have been selectively retained: alternative splicing of strongly tissue-specific NAGNAGs was ten times as likely to be conserved between species as for non-tissue-specific events. Further, alternative splicing of human NAGNAGs was associated with an order of magnitude increase in the frequency of exon length changes at orthologous mouse/rat exon boundaries, suggesting that NAGNAGs accelerate exon evolution. Together, our analyses show that NAGNAG alternative splicing constitutes a major generator of tissue-specific proteome diversity and accelerates evolution of proteins at exon-exon boundaries."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE30017GSE30567	ENCODE Cold Spring Harbor Labs Long RNA-seq (hg19)	"This data was generated by ENCODE.

We integrated multiple ENCODE Consortium resources with the Hi-C data, using DNase-seq data and ChIP-seq data for 46 transcription factors and 8 histone modifications. We classified 12 different sets (clusters) of interacting loci that can be distinguished by their chromatin modifications and which can be categorized into three types of chromatin hubs. The different clusters of loci display very different relationships with transcription factor binding sites. As expected, many of the transcription factors show binding patterns specific to clusters composed of interacting loci that encompass promoters or enhancers. However, cluster 6, which is distinguished by marks of open chromatin but not by marks of active enhancers or promoters, was not bound by most transcription factors but was highly enriched for 3 transcription factors (GATA1, GATA2, and c-Jun) and 3 chromatin modifiers (BRG1, INI1, and SIRT6). To validate the identification of the clusters and to dissect the impact of chromatin organization on gene regulation, we performed RNA-seq analyses before and after knockdown of GATA1 or GATA2. We found that knockdown of the GATA factors greatly alters the expression of genes within cluster 6. Our work, in combination with previous studies linking regulation by GATA factors with c-Jun and BRG1, provide genome-wide evidence that Hi-C data identifies sets of biologically relevant interacting loci."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE32213GSE32260	"Relationship between DNMT1-RNA interactions, DNA methylation and gene expression"	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE32260GSE32307	Transposon-based construction of strand-specific RNA-seq libraries	We have developed two methods for efficiently consructing RNA-seq libraries using transposition.

"As a preliminary step towards applying next generation sequencing using neurons derived from patient-specific iPSCs, we have carried out an RNA-Seq analysis on control human neurons. Dramatic changes in the expression of coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), pseudogenes, and splice isoforms were seen during the transition from pluripotent stem cells to early differentiating neurons. A number of genes that undergo radical changes in expression during this transition include candidates for schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that function as transcription factors and chromatin modifiers, such as POU3F2 and ZNF804A, and genes coding for cell adhesion proteins implicated in these conditions including NRXN1 and NLGN1. In addition, a number of novel lncRNAs were found to undergo dramatic changes in expression, one of which is HOTAIRM1, a regulator of several HOXA genes during myelopoiesis. The increase we observed in differentiating neurons suggests a role in neurogenesis as well. Finally, several lncRNAs that map near SNPs associated with SZ in genome wide association studies also increase during neuronal differentiation, suggesting that these novel transcripts may be abnormally regulated in a subgroup of patients."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE32625GSE33092	Oncogenic BRAFV600E remodels the melanocyte transcriptome and induces BANCR to regulate melanoma cell migration [HT-seq]	"Most cancer genomics papers to date have focused on aberrations in genomic DNA and protein-coding transcripts.

We performed RNA-seq in BRAFv600e melanoma skin cancer and on melanocytes over-expressing oncogenic BRAF to catalog transcriptome remodeling. We discovered that BRAF regulates expression of 1027 protein coding transcripts, 39 annotated lncRNAs and 70 novel transcripts. Many of the novel transcripts are lncRNAs. We used an indepenedent dataset to interrogate our novel transcripts and found that the novel lncRNA BANCR is a BRAF-regulated lncRNA recurrently upregulated in melanoma.

Here we present a comprehensive study to elucidate how heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) proteins, among the most abundant RNA binding proteins, coordinate to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) in human cells. Using splicing-sensitive microarrays, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing, and cDNA sequencing, we find that more than half of all AS events are regulated by multiple hnRNP proteins, and that some combinations of hnRNP proteins exhibit significant synergy, whereas others act antagonistically. Our analyses reveal position-dependent RNA splicing maps, in vivo consensus binding sites, a surprising level of cross- and auto-regulation among hnRNP proteins, and the coordinated regulation by hnRNP proteins of dozens of other RNA binding proteins and genes associated with cancer.

For cells maintained in the medium used to differentiate RPE, 6.2%% (H1-RPE) and 4.2%% (H9-RPE) of the transcripts were expressed in amounts that were statistically different from hfRPE (false discovery rate: 5%%). After adaptation to the serum-free medium, SFM-1, only 1.0 %% (H1-RPE) and 1.9%% (H9-RPE) were expressed in amounts that were statistically different. For RPE signature genes, statistical differences were observed for 1.0 %% (H1-RPE) and 1.9%% (H9-RPE) of the transcripts. For some barrier-function related mRNAs the statistical differences were greater than these small differences would predict. For adhesion proteins and plasma membrane transporters, the differences were as great as 6.9%% and 4.3%%, respectively. After adaptation to SFM-1, the statistical differences between H1- and H9-RPE were only 0.4%% for all transcripts, 1.4%% for signature genes, and 0.7%% for membrane transporters. No statistical differences were observed for the transcripts related to tight junctions, adhesion junctions or ion channels.

To understand the dynamics of polyadenylation site usage, we mapped transcriptomewide both binding sites of 3' end processing factors CPSF160, CPSF100, CPSF73, CPSF30, Fip1, CstF64, CstF-64tau, CF Im25, CF Im59, and CF Im68 and 3' end processing sites in HEK293 cells. We found that although binding sites of these factors generally cluster around the poly(A) sites most frequently used in cleavage, CstF64/CstF-64tau and CF Im proteins have much higher positional specificity compared to CPSF components. Knockdown of CF Im68 induced a systematic use of proximal polyadenylation sites, indicating that changes in relative abundance of a single 3' end processing factor can modulate the length of 3' untranslated regions transcriptome-wide, and suggesting a mechanism behind the previously observed increase in tumor cell invasiveness upon CF Im68 knockdown."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37037GSE37211	DPN and Tamoxifen treatments of parathyroid adenoma cells	"Stimulation of estrogen receptor beta in PHPT, genetic changes after 24 and 48h of treatments vs. Control"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37211GSE37524	Mixture models and wavelet transforms reveal high confidence RNA-protein interaction sites in MOV10 PAR-CLIP data	"The Photo-Activatable Ribonucleoside-enhanced CrossLinking and ImmunoPrecipitation (PAR-CLIP) method was recently developed for global identification of RNAs interacting with proteins. The strength of this versatile method results from induction of specific T to C transitions at sites of interaction. However, current analytical tools do not distinguish between non-experimentally and experimentally induced transitions. Furthermore, geometric properties at potential binding sites are not taken into account. To surmount these shortcomings, we developed a two-step algorithm consisting of a non-parametric two-component mixture model and a wavelet-based peak calling procedure. Our algorithm can reduce the number of false positives up to 24%% thereby identifying high confidence interaction sites. We successfully employed this approach in conjunction with a modified PAR-CLIP protocol to study the functional role of nuclear MOV10, a putative RNA helicase interacting with Argonaute2 and Polycomb.

We have previously identified 87 signature genes relevant to RPE cell differentiation and function through transcriptome analysis of both human ESC- and iPSC-derived RPE as well as normal fetal RPE. Here, we profiled miRNA expression through small RNA-seq in human ESCs and their RPE derivatives. Much like conclusions drawn from our previous transcriptome analysis, we found that the overall miRNA landscape in RPE is distinct from ESCs and other differentiated somatic tissues. We also profiled miRNA expression during intermediate stages of RPE differentiation and identified unique subsets of miRNAs that are gradually up- or downregulated, suggesting dynamic regulation of these miRNAs is associated with the RPE differentiation process. Indeed, the down-regulation of a subset of miRNAs during RPE differentiation is associated with up-regulation of RPE-specific genes, such as RPE65, which is exclusively expressed in RPE. We conclude that miRNA signatures can be used to classify different degrees of in vitro differentiation of RPE from human pluripotent stem cells. We suggest that RPE-specific miRNAs likely contribute to the functional maturation of RPE in vitro, similar to the regulation of RPE-specific mRNA expression."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37686GSE37703	Differential analysis of HOXA1 in adult cells at isoform resolution by RNA-Seq [Illumina]	"High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has enabled accurate gene discovery and expression estimation, but robust differential analysis of gene and transcript abundances has proven difficult.

We show that HOXA1 is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression, and loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37703GSE37769	mRNA profiling of THP1 cell line	Analysis of mRNA in THP1 (human monocytic leukemia) cell line in order to correlate miRNA activity with target abundance.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37769GSE37918	RNA-seq in breast cancer cell lines after manipulation of miR-23b expression	RNA sequencing technology has been carried out in order to evaluate mRNA expression changes after manipulation of miR-23b in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37918GSE38157	The mRNA-bound proteome and its global occupancy profile on protein-coding transcripts	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE38157GSE38233	Study functions of ADAR proteins using next generation sequencing of genome and transcriptome	"Adenosine deaminases, RNA specific (ADAR) are proteins that deaminate adenosine to inosine which is then recognized in translation as guanosine. To study the roles of ADAR proteins in RNA editing and gene regulation, we carried out DNA and RNA sequencing, RNA interference and RNA-immunoprecipitation in human B-cells. We also characterized the ADAR protein complex by mass spectrometry. The results uncovered over 60,000 sites where the adenosines (A) are edited to guanosine (G) and several thousand genes whose expression levels are influenced by ADAR. We also identified more than 100 proteins in the ADAR protein complex; these include splicing factors, heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins and several members of the dynactin protein family. Our findings show that in human B-cells, ADAR proteins are involved in two independent functions: A-to-G editing and gene expression regulation. In addition, we showed that other types of RNA-DNA sequence differences are not mediated by ADAR proteins, and thus there are co- or post-transcriptional mechanisms yet to be determined."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE38233GSE38234	Genistein and bisphenol A exposure cause estrogen receptor 1 to bind thousands of binding sites in a cell type-specific manner	"To obtain an integrated view of gene regulation in response to environmental and endogenous estrogens on a genome-wide scale, we performed ChIP-seq, to identify estrogen receptor 1 (ER) binding sites, and RNA-seq in endometrial cancer cells exposed to bisphenol A (BPA; found in plastics), genistein (GEN; found in soybean), or 17-estradiol (E2; an endogenous estrogen).GEN and BPA treatment induces thousands of ER binding sites and >50 gene expression changes, representing a subset of E2induced gene regulation changes. Genes affected by E2 were highly enriched for ribosome-associated proteins; however, GEN and BPA failed to regulate most ribosome-associated proteins and instead enriched for transporters of carboxylic acids. Treatment-dependent changes in gene expression were associated with treatment-dependent ER binding sites, with the exception that many genes up-regulated by E2 harbored a BPA-induced ER binding site, but failed to show any expression change after BPA treatment. GEN and BPA exhibited a similar relationship to E2 in the breast cancer line T-47D, where cell type specificity played a much larger role than treatment specificity. Overall, both environmental estrogens clearly regulate gene expression through ER on a genome-wide scale, although with lower potency resulting in less ER binding sites and less gene expression changes compared to the endogenous estrogen, E2."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE38234GSE38265	mRNA expression in iPS cells generated by a synthetic self-replicative RNA	"We generated iPS cells with a synthetic self-replicative RNA that expresses four independent reprogramming factors (OCT4, KLF4, SOX2 and either c-MYC or GLIS1).

One mechanism by which TCF7L2 could influence expression of genes involved in diverse diseases is by binding to distinct regulatory regions in different tissues. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-seq for TCF7L2 in 6 human cell lines. We identified 116,000 non-redundant TCF7L2 binding sites, with only 1,864 sites common to the 6 cell lines. Using ChIP-seq, we showed that many genomic regions that are marked by both H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac are also bound by TCF7L2, suggesting that TCF7L2 plays a critical role in enhancer activity. Bioinformatic analysis of the cell type-specific TCF7L2 binding sites revealed enrichment for multiple transcription factors, including HNF4alpha and FOXA2 motifs in HepG2 cells and the GATA3 motif in MCF7 cells. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that TCF7L2 co-localizes with HNF4alpha and FOXA2 in HepG2 cells and with GATA3 in MCF7 cells. Interestingly, in MCF7 cells the TCF7L2 motif is enriched in most TCF7L2 sites but is not enriched in the sites bound by both GATA3 and TCF7L2. This analysis suggested that GATA3 might tether TCF7L2 to the genome at these sites. To test this hypothesis, we depleted GATA3 in MCF7 cells and showed that TCF7L2 binding was lost at a subset of sites. RNA-seq analysis suggested that TCF7L2 represses transcription when tethered to the genome via GATA3. Our studies demonstrate a novel relationship between GATA3 and TCF7L2, and reveal important insights into TCF7L2-mediated gene regulation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE38447GSE38541	Human PA-1 cells treated with scrambled or specific ASOs	"We describe the discovery of sno-lncRNAs, a class of nuclear-enriched intron-derived long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are processed on both ends by the snoRNA machinery. During exonucleolytic trimming, the sequences between the snoRNAs are not degraded, leading to the accumulation of lncRNAs flanked by snoRNA sequences but lacking 5' caps and 3' poly(A) tails. Such RNAs are widely expressed in cells and tissues and can be produced by either box C/D or box H/ACA snoRNAs. Importantly, the genomic region encoding one abundant class of sno-lncRNAs (15q11-q13) is specifically deleted in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). The PWS region sno-lncRNAs do not colocalize with nucleoli or Cajal bodies, but rather accumulate near their sites of synthesis. These sno-lncRNAs associate strongly with Fox family splicing regulators and alter patterns of splicing. These results thus implicate a previously unannotated class of lncRNAs in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE38541GSE38770	Histone variant H2A.Bbd is associated with active transcription and mRNA processing in human cells [RNA-Seq]	"Variation in chromatin composition and organization often reflects differences in genome function. Histone variants, for example, replace canonical histones to contribute to regulation of numerous nuclear processes including transcription, DNA repair and chromosome segregation. Here we focus on H2A.Bbd, a rapidly evolving variant found in mammals but not in invertebrates. We report that in human cells, nucleosomes bearing H2A.Bbd form unconventional chromatin structures enriched within actively transcribed genes and characterized by shorter DNA protection and nucleosome spacing. Analysis of transcriptional profiles from cells depleted for H2A.Bbd demonstrated widespread changes in gene expression with a net down-regulation of transcription and disruption of normal mRNA splicing patterns. In particular, we observed changes in exon inclusion rates and increased presence of intronic sequences in mRNA products upon H2A.Bbd depletion. Taken together, our results indicate that H2A.Bbd is involved in formation of a specific chromatin structure that facilitates both transcription and initial mRNA processing."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE38770GSE38945	Gene expression of three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with different organ-tropism.

Whether target tissue CD40 expression plays a role in autoimmune disease etiology has yet to be determined. Here we show for the first time, that target-tissue over-expression of CD40 plays a key role in the etiology of autoimmunity. Using a murine model of GD, we demonstrated that thyroidal CD40 over-expression augmented the production of thyroid specific antibodies, resulting in more severe experimental autoimmune Graves disease (EAGD), whereas deletion of thyroidal CD40 suppressed disease. Using transcriptome and immune-pathway analyses we showed that in both EAGD mouse thyroids and human primary thyrocytes, CD40 mediates this effect by activating downstream cytokines and chemokines, most notably IL-6. To translate these findings into therapy, we blocked IL-6 during EAGD induction in the setting of thyroidal CD40 over-expression, and showed decreased levels of TSHR stimulating antibodies and frequency of disease. We conclude that target tissue over-expression of CD40 plays a key role in the etiology of organ specific autoimmune disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39081GSE39086	DGCR8 HITS-CLIP reveals novel functions for the Microprocessor (CLIP-seq)	"The Drosha-DGCR8 complex (Microprocessor) is required for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. DGCR8 contains two double-stranded RNA binding motifs that recognize the RNA substrate, whereas Drosha functions as the endonuclease. We have used high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify endogenous RNA targets of DGCR8 in mammalian cells. Unexpectedly, miRNAs were not the most abundant targets. DGCR8-bound RNAs comprised several hundred mRNAs as well as snoRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. We found that DGCR8 together with Drosha controls the abundance of several mRNAs, as well as long non-coding RNAs, such as MALAT-1. By contrast, the DGCR8-mediated cleavage of snoRNAs is independent of Drosha, suggesting the involvement of DGCR8 in cellular complexes with other endonucleases. Interestingly, binding of DGCR8 to cassette exons, acts as a novel mechanism to regulate the relative abundance of alternatively spliced isoforms. Collectively, these data provide new insights in the complex role of DGCR8 in controlling the fate of several classes of RNAs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39086GSE39118	RNA-Seq and expression data from human adipose tissue	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39118GSE39121	Lung adenocarcinoma metastasis is suppressed by the alveolar lineage transcription factors GATA6 and HOPX.	"Molecular programs that mediate normal cell differentiation are required for oncogenesis and tumor cell survival in certain cancers. How cell-lineage-restricted genes specifically influence metastasis is poorly defined. In lung cancers, we uncovered a transcriptional program that is preferentially associated with distal airway epithelial differentiation and lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) progression. This program is regulated in part by the lineage transcription factors GATA6 and HOPX. These factors can cooperatively limit the metastatic competence of ADC cells, by modulating overlapping alveolar differentiation and invasogenic target genes. Thus, GATA6 and HOPX are critical nodes in a lineage-selective pathway that directly links effectors of airway epithelial specification to the inhibition of metastasis in the lung ADC subtype."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39121GSE39187	Embedding siRNA sequences targeting Apolipoprotein B100 in shRNA and miRNA scaffolds results in differential processing and in vivo efficacy	"Purpose: Identical predicted small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences targeting Apolipoprotein B100 (siApoB) were embedded in shRNA (shApoB) or miRNA (miApoB) scaffolds and a direct compariso of the possible aspecific off-target effects in vivo was performed. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of small RNAs originating from shApoB- or miApoB-transfected cells revealed substantial differences in processing, resulting in different siApoB length, 5 and 3 cleavage sites and abundance of the guide or passenger strands. Methods [1]: Total liver RNA sequencing libraries for the Illumina sequencing platform were generated using high-quality total RNA as input and the Illumina TrueSeq RNA v2 Sample preparation kit according to the manufacturers protocol. Each read file (sample), in the FASTQ format, was individually aligned against the mouse reference genome (15 May 2012 NCBI build 38.1) using CLC Bio-Genomic Workbench and the expression abundance for each gene (RPKM) was calculated according to Montazavi et al. Result [1]s: Based on our previous observations that shApoB and miApoB are differentially processed and that miApoB has a different passenger, we checked for possible aspecific off-target effects in vivo. NGS liver transcriptome analysis was performed 8 weeks p.i. for animals injected with 1x1011 gc AAV encoding shScr, shApoB, miScr and miApoB. We investigated whether shApoB and miApoB processing differences translate into differences in gene expression in injected animals. A total number of 266 genes were significantly changing (p <0,05) in miApoB-injected mice compared to miScr. Additionally 106 genes were found to be significantly up or down-regulated in the shApoB mice compared to shScr. Off-target predictions using Smith-Waterman algorithm for the most abundant guide and passenger strand variants were performed to investigate if any of the observed changes results from aspecific interactions. None of the changing genes had predicted targets for the guide or passenger strands of shApoB or miApoB. Conclusions [1]: An important observation is that none of the changes in gene expression in AAV-miApoB and AAV-shApoB can be explained by possible aspecific down-regulation of non-target transcripts. Methods [2]: For NGS analysis cells were transfected with 4 g shApoB- or miApoB-expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and total RNA was isolated from cells 48 hr post-transfection using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturers protocol. Total RNA sequencing libraries for the Illumina sequencing platform were generated using high-quality total RNA as input and the Illumina TrueSeq RNA v2 Sample preparation kit according to the manufacturers protocol. The NGS small RNA raw data set was analyzed using the CLC_bio genomic workbench (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). The obtained reads were adaptor-trimmed, which decreased the average read size from ~36bp to ~25bp. The custom adapter sequenced used for trimming all the bases extending 5 was: GTGACTGGAGTTCC-TTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA. All reads containing ambiguity N symbols, reads shorter than 15 nt, longer than 55 nt in length and reads represented less than 10 times were discarded. Next, both data sets from shApoB and miApoB samples were grouped based on the match to the reference sequence and the obtained unique small RNAs were aligned to the sequence of pre-miApoB: GATCCTGGAGGCTTGC-TGAAGGCTGTATGCTGATGGACAGGTCAATCAATCTTGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACAAGATTGAGACCTGTCCATCAGGACACAAGGCCTGTTACTAGCACTCACATGGAACAAATGGCCCAGATCTGGCCGCAG or shApoB: GATCCCCGATTGATTGACCTGTCCATTTCAAGAGAATGGACAGGTCAATCAATC-TTTTTCAGCTT sequence, respectively. To relatively represent the expression counts for the small RNAs obtained in the experiment, reads per million (rpm) or percentage of reads based on the total number of reads matching the reference shApoB or miApoB sequence were calculated Results [2]: The small RNAs were aligned against their reference sequence resulting in 541.939 reads matching shApoB and 1.525.211 reads matching miApoB (Fig S1 and S2). Analysis of the length distribution of the reads indicated that siApoB guide strand originating from shApoB ranged between 19 and 23 nt, with the most abundant one being 21 nt-long. Surprisingly, siApoB guide from miApoB scaffold ranged from 23 to 25 nt with the 24 nt-long strand being the predominant variant. This finding was rather unexpected considering that the predicted guide strand of siApoB was 21 nt long for both shApoB and miApoB scaffolds. Analysis of the processed 5 ends of the siApoB guide strand indicated that most of the reads matched position +1 relative to the predicted cleavage site for shApoB, while all the reads matched position 0 for miApoB. The 3 ends of the siApoB guide strand had a more heterogeneous pattern and ranged from -1 to +3 for shApoB and +1 to +4 for miApoB. Next, we looked at the sequence distribution and percentage of reads for both the guide and passenger siApoB strands originating from the shApoB and miApoB scaffolds. A substantial difference between the two is that the guide from shApoB is in the 3 arm and hence Dicer or other endonuclease defines the cleavage position while the guide is present in the 5 arm of miApoB, where Drosha defines the cleavage. Thus, defining the length and exact cleavage position for the guide and passenger strands is very important since even single nucleotide differences may result in significant changes in the predicted targets of the siRNAs. Moreover, the passenger siRNA* strand, if not degraded efficiently, may bind to unanticipated targets and cause off-target effects. As expected, 44.4%% of the reads originating from shApoB matched the siApoB guide strand but processing was shifted at position +1 (Fig. 2d, upper panel). Surprisingly only 12.1%% of the reads matched perfectly the predicted siApoB guide strand of 21 nt and starting at position 0. The reads matching the passenger siApoB* strand were represented in much lower percentage with the predominant one being only 5.3%%. Analysis of the guide strand from the siApoB reads originating from the miApoB scaffold indicated that they all started at the predicted cleavage site. Surprisingly, the predominant, 22.3%% of reads were 24 nt-long. Furthermore 5.1%% reads were 23 nt- and 1.9%% were 25 nt-long. A substantial number of 62%% of the reads was found matching the passenger siApoB* strand and ranged between 20 and 22 nt in length. In conclusion, both shApoB and miApoB scaffolds did not yield the predicted siApoB guide or siApoB* passenger sequences after processing from the cellular RNAi machinery. The guide from miApoB was cleaved much more precisely by Drosha at its 5 end compared to shApoB that gave more heterogeneous pools of sequences following processing. Conclusions[2]: An unexpected discovery in the current study was that siRNA processing by the cellular RNAi machinery did not follow the generally accepted and described cleavage sites for both molecules shApoB and miApoB siApoB guide strand originating from the shApoB scaffold was more heterogeneous in cleavage sites and length compared to the product originating from the miApoB scaffold. Most likely, differential cleavage mechanism defined the heterogeneity in the guide and passenger strands. Additionally, shRNAs with 19 bp stem or less are not necessarily recognized by Dicer and maybe be processed differently. The heterogeneity seen with the shApoB can also be explained by the potential for 2 or 3 uridines to be added following termination of pol III transcription. The main pool of guide sequences originating from miApoB was 24 nt-long although we used the scaffold of cellular pri-mir-155 that produces a 23 nt mature miRNA. However, a 24 nt-long siApoB sequence did not compromise efficacy because when placed in the miApoB scaffold, the ApoB target sequence was extended at the 3 end with 4 nt until the loop. Another important observation is that the siApoB*"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39187GSE39436	MicroRNA profiling and discovery by deep sequencing cord blood from Down syndrome fetuses	"To investigate the expression characteristic of miRNAs during the development of Down syndrome (DS) fetuses and to identify whether another miRNA gene resides in the Hsa21, we employed high-throughput Solexa sequencing technology to comprehensively characterize the miRNA expression profiles of both DS and normal fetal cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs). In total, 200 of 395 identified miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (fold change > 2.0 and P-value < 0.001) and 2 of 181 candidate novel miRNAs were identified as residing within the 'Down syndrome critical region' of human chromosome 21 (chr21q22.2-22.3). Additionally, 7 of 14 Hsa21-derived miRNAs genes were detected that three miRNAs (hsa-miR-802, miR-3648, miR-3687) were up-regulated more than 50%% and four miRNAs (hsa-miR-99a, let-7c, miR-125b-2, miR-155) were down-regulated in the DS fetal CBMCs compared with the control. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that abnormally expressed miRNAs were major associated with the regulation of transcription, gene expression, cellular biosynthetic process, macromolecule biosynthetic process and nucleic acid metabolic process. The data obtained in our study provides a considerable insight into understanding the expression characteristic of miRNAs in the DS fetal hemopoietic system and the differentially expressed miRNAs may be involved in the hemopoietic abnormalities and the immune defects of DS fetus and newborns."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39436GSE39682	FMR1 targets distinct mRNA sequence elements to regulate protein expression [PAR-CLIP]	"Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is a multi-organ disease leading to mental retardation, macro-orchidism in males, and premature ovarian insufficiency in female carriers. FXS is also a prominent monogenic disease associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). FXS is typically caused by the loss of FRAGILE X-MENTAL RETARDATION 1 (FMR1) expression, which encodes for the RNA-binding protein (RBP), FMR1 (or FMRP). We report the discovery of the RNA recognition elements (RREs), binding sites, and mRNA targets for wild-type and I304N mutant FMRP isoforms as well as its paralogs, FXR1 and FXR2. RRE frequency, ratio, and distribution determine target mRNA association with FMRP. Among highly-enriched targets, we identified many genes involved in ASD and demonstrate that FMRP can affect their protein levels in cell culture, mice, and human brain. Unexpectedly, we discovered that these targets are also dysregulated in Fmr1-/- mouse ovaries, showing signs of premature follicular overdevelopment. These results indicate that FMRP targets shared signaling pathways across different cellular contexts. As it is become increasingly appreciated that signaling pathways are important to FXS and ASD, our results here provide an invaluable molecular guide towards the pursuit of novel therapeutic targets for these devastating neurological disorders."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39682GSE39748	Argonaute proteins couple chromatin silencing to alternative splicing (RNA IP-Seq)	"While Argonaute (AGO) proteins play a major role in transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in many organisms, their role in the nucleus of somatic mammalian cells remains elusive. Here, we have purified AGO1 and AGO2 chromatin-embedded complexes, and found these proteins associated with previously described partners, but also with chromatin modifiers and, rather unexpectedly, with different splicing factors. Using the CD44 gene as a model for alternative splicing, we show that both AGO1 and AGO2 are required for Protein Kinase C (PKC)-dependent variant exon inclusion. AGO proteins facilitate the spliceosome recruitment and modulate the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The recruitment of AGO proteins to CD44 transcribed region is dependent on both the endonuclease Dicer and the chromodomain-containing protein HP1g, and results in locally increased levels of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation on variant exons. Genome wide analysis of splicing in either AGO2 or Dicer null cells showed that the two proteins have similar effects on many splicing events. Finally, sRNAs associated with nuclear AGO2 are mostly in sense orientation relative to protein-coding genes, supporting a role for intragenic antisense non-coding RNAs in the recruitment AGO and splicing factors. Together, our data demonstrate for the first time that the endogenous RNAi pathway is involved in alternative splicing decisions, unravelling a new model in which AGO proteins couple RNAPII elongation and chromatin modification."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39748GSE39757	Transcriptomic analysis of XIST+ and XIST- hES cells	"Purpose: Compare the transcriptome of homogeneous XIST+ and XIST- hES cell populations.

Results: We took advantage of the clonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation in H9 cells and analyzed the data in an allelic manner. By comparing the RNA-Seq data with known H9 SNPs, we identified genomic positions which were relaxed from XCI in XIST- cells compared to XIST+ cells.

Here, we sequenced nascent RNA and found all 12 types of RNA-DNA differences. Using various experimental analyses, we validated this finding. Our results showed that sequences of nascent RNAs within 40 nucleotides of the exit channel of RNA polymerase II already differ from the corresponding DNA sequences. These RNA-DNA differences are mediated by RNA processing steps closely coupled with transcription and not by known deaminase-mediated RNA editing mechanisms nor during NTP incorporation by Pol II.

Upon ligand binding, the AR binds to thousands of genomic loci and activates a cell-type specific gene program. Prostate cancer growth and progression depend on androgen-induced AR signalling. Treatment of advanced prostate cancer through medical or surgical castration leads to initial response and durable remission, but resistance inevitably develops. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), AR activity remains critical for tumor growth despite androgen deprivation. While previous studies have focused on ligand-dependent AR signalling, in this study we explore AR function under the androgen-deprived conditions characteristic of CRPC. Our data demonstrate that the AR persistently occupies a distinct set of genomic loci after androgen deprivation in CRPC. These androgen-independent AR occupied regions have constitutively open chromatin structures that lack the canonical androgen response element and are independent of FoxA1, a transcription factor involved in ligand-dependent AR targeting. Many AR binding events occur at proximal promoters, which can act as enhancers to augment transcriptional activities of other promoters through DNA looping. We further show that androgen-independent AR binding directs a distinct gene expression program in CRPC, which is necessary for the growth of CRPC after androgen withdrawal."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40050GSE40111	Stochastic genome - nuclear lamina contacts are linked to histone H3K9 dimethylation (RNA-seq data)	"The nuclear lamina (NL) interacts with hundreds of large genomic regions termed lamina-associated domains (LADs). The dynamics of these interactions and the relation to epigenetic modifications are poorly understood. We visualized the fate of LADs in single cells using a novel 'molecular contact memory' approach. In each interphase nucleus, only ~30%% of LADs are positioned at the periphery; these LADs are in intermittent molecular contact with the NL but remain constrained to the periphery. Upon mitosis, LAD positioning is not detectably inherited but instead is stochastically reshuffled. Contact of individual LADs with the NL correlates with their degree of H3K9 dimethylation in single cells, and inactivation of the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a reduces the NL contact frequencies. These results indicate that nuclear positioning and histone modification of LADs are both stochastic yet linked in single cells.

Here we demonstrate a role for histone acetylation in regulating intracellular pH (pHi). As pHi decreases, histones are globally deacetylated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the released acetate anions are co-exported with protons out of the cell by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), preventing further reductions in pHi. Conversely, global histone acetylation increases at more alkaline pHi, such as when resting cells are induced to proliferate. Inhibition of HDACs or MCTs decreases acetate export and lowers pHi, particularly compromising pHi maintenance in acidic environments. Global deacetylation at low pH is reflected at a genomic level by decreased abundance and extensive redistribution of acetylation at promoters and intergenic regions. Thus acetylation of chromatin functions as a rheostat to regulate pHi with important implications for therapeutic use of HDAC inhibitors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40114GSE40132	ALKBH5 is a New Mammalian RNA Demethylase	"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) in higher eukaryotes. Here we report ALKBH5 as a new mammalian demethylase that oxidatively removes the m6A modification in mRNA in vitro and inside cells. This demethylation activity of ALKBH5 significantly affects mRNA export and RNA metabolism as well as the assembly of mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. Alkbh5-deficient male mice are characterized by impaired fertility resulting from apoptosis that affects meiotic metaphase-stage spermatocytes. In accordance with this defect, we have identified in mouse testes 1552 differentially expressed genes which cover broad functional categories and include spermatogenesis-related mRNAs involved in the p53 functional interaction network. We show that Alkbh5-deficiency impacts the expression levels of some of these mRNAs, supporting the observed phenotype. The discovery of this new RNA demethylase strongly suggests that the reversible m6A modification plays fundamental and broad functions in mammalian cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40132GSE40137	Cleavage Factor Im as a key regulator of 3 UTR length	"In eukaryotes, the 3' ends of RNA polymerase II-generated transcripts are made in the majority of cases by site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by the addition of a poly(A) tail. By alternative polyadenylation, a gene can give rise to multiple mRNA isoforms that differ in the length of their 3' UTRs and hence in their susceptibility to post-transcriptional regulatory factors such as microRNAs. A series of recently conducted high-throughput studies of poly(A) site usage revealed an extensive tissue-specific control of 3 UTR length and drastic changes in 3 UTR length of mRNAs upon induction of proliferation in resting cells. To understand the dynamics of polyadenylation site usage, we recently identified binding sites of the major pre-mRNA 3 end processing factors - cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), and cleavage factor Im (CF Im) - and mapped cleaved polyadenylation sites in HEK293 cells. Our present study extends previous findings on the role of CF Im in alternative polyadenylation and reveals that subunits of the CF Im complex generally control 3 UTR length. More specifically, we demonstrate that the loss-of-function of CF Im68 and CF Im25 but not of CF Im59 leads to a transcriptome-wide increase of the use of proximal polyadenylation sites."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40137GSE40199	Whole Genome sequencing of a normal karyotype AML cell line	"Normal Karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (NK-AML) represents approximately 50%% of all cases of AML which patients develop.

We previously reported that Terminal uridylyl transferase 4 (TUT4) down-regulates let-7 miRNA biogenesis by oligo-uridylating let-7 precursor (pre-let-7) in mouse embryonic stem cells and that a pluripotency marker Lin28 promotes a processivity of TUT4. Here we find that TUT4 positively controls let-7 biogenesis by adding a uridine residue to the 3 end of pre-let-7 in the absence of Lin28. Such mono-uridylation enhances Dicer processing by generating an optimal end structure of pre-let-7 for Dicer recognition and may protect pre-miRNA from trimming. Moreover, TUT7, TUT4 and TUT2 redundantly regulate pre-let-7 processing and simultaneous knock down of these TUTs leads to the decrease of mature let-7 and the accumulation of pre-let-7 in cells. This study provides a novel regulation mechanism of miRNA biogenesis, which may function in development and tumorigenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40228GSE40243	Hydroxymethylation at gene regulatory regions directs stem cell commitment during erythropoiesis	CD34 positive hematopoietic stem cells were differentiated into erythroid lineage.

However, these PSC-ECs are unstable and often drift towards non-vascular cell fates. We show that human mid-gestation c-Kit- lineage-committed amniotic cells (ACs) can be reprogrammed into induced vascular endothelial cells (rAC-VECs). Transient ETV2 expression in ACs generated immature iVECs, while co-expression with FLI1/ERG1 endowed rAC-VECs with a vascular repertoire and morphology matching mature ECs. Brief TGFb-inhibition functionalizes VEGFR2 signaling, augmenting specification of ACs into rAC-VECs. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses showed that rAC-VECs are similar to adult ECs in which vascular-specific genes are expressed and non-vascular genes are silenced. Functionally, rAC-VECs form stable vasculature in Matrigel plugs and regenerating livers. Thus, short-term ETV2 expression and TGFb-inhibition along with constitutive ERG1/FLI1 co-expression reprogram mature ACs into generic rAC-VECs with clinical-scale expansion potential. Public banking of HLA-typed rAC-VECs would establish a vascular inventory for treatment of genetically diverse disorders."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40291GSE40524	Unprecedented alternative splicing and 3 Mb of novel transcribed sequence leads to significant transcript diversity in the transcriptome of the human retina	"The mRNA repertoire is specific to a given tissue type. This specificity, whether it is in the levels of gene expression or the splicing pattern of the transcripts, is important to study to increase our general knowledge of transcription and alternative splicing, as well as to identify novel coding sequence that can be important for elucidating the mechanisms of disease. We have performed RNA-Seq on three normal human retinal samples and have found a profound level of novel alternative splicing including novel exons, exon skipping, and 3 and 5 alternate splice sites. Additionally, we have identified hundreds of novel genes. With so many novel splicing events identified in the retinal transcriptome, we set out to determine if these novel features were indeed real. We developed a high throughput capture set to target 14,696 of the novel features. We found that 99%% of the novel features do validate, including those initially detected at a depth of coverage as low as one.

FUS/TLS is shown to bind RNAs from >5,500 genes in mouse and human brain, primarily through a GUGGU binding motif. A characteristic sawtooth-like binding pattern is identified, supporting co-transcriptional deposition of FUS/TLS. Depletion of FUS/TLS from the adult nervous system is shown to alter levels or splicing of >970 mRNAs, most of which are distinct from the RNAs whose maturation is dependent on TDP-43. Nonetheless, only 55 RNAs are reduced upon depletion of either TDP-43 or FUS/TLS from mouse brain and human neurons differentiated from pluripotent stem cells, including mRNAs transcribed from genes with exceptionally long introns and that encode proteins essential for neuronal integrity. A subset of these is significantly lowered in FUS/TLSR521G and TDP-43G298S mutant fibroblasts and in TDP-43 aggregate-containing motor neurons in sporadic ALS, evidence pointing to a common loss-of-function pathway as one component underlying motor neuron death from misregulation of TDP-43 or FUS/TLS."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40651GSE40705	Comprehensive comparative analysis of RNA sequencing methods for degraded or low input samples	"RNA-Seq is an effective method to study the transcriptome, but can be difficult to apply to scarce or degraded RNA from fixed clinical samples, rare cell populations, or cadavers. Recent studies have proposed several methods for RNA-Seq of low quality and/or low quantity samples, but their relative merits have not been systematically analyzed. Here, we compare five such methods using a comprehensive set of metrics, relevant to applications such as transcriptome annotation, transcript discovery, and gene expression. Using a single human RNA sample, we constructed and deeply sequenced 10 libraries with these methods and two control libraries. We find that the RNase H method performed best for low quality RNA, and can even effectively replace oligo (dT) based methods for standard RNA-Seq.

High-throughput, whole-transcriptome sequencing of the 3UTR ends of polyadenylated mRNA transcripts (termed pA-RNAseq; see Methods) was performed on a cohort of 17 unaffected and 17 PD cerebral cortical tissue samples. This revealed 5 aSyn 3UTR isoforms, with lengths of 290, 480, 560, 1070 and 2520 nt. Of these, the 560 nt and 2520 nt forms were predominant. The existence and relative preponderance of these species was further confirmed by Northern Blot. We next hypothesized, that aSyn 3UTR selection might be altered in PD. Comparison of pA-RNAseq profiles from PD and unaffected cerebral cortex samples revealed an increase in the preponderance of the long 3UTR species (>560 nt) relative to shorter species (<560 nt). Such a relative increase in aSynL was confirmed by Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (rt-qPCR) and appeared specific for PD, as the increase was also observed by comparison to RNA from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient samples. We note that the modified aSyn 3UTR selection associated with PD patient tissue was detected in cerebral cortex tissue, which typically harbors pathological evidence of the disease process without frank cell loss; thus, this phenotype is unlikely to be a secondary consequence of neurodegeneration."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40710GSE40778	CLIP-seq of eIF4AIII reveals transcriptome-wide mapping of the human exon junction complex	"The exon junction complex (EJC) is a central effector of mRNAs fate, linking nuclear processing to mRNA transport, translation and surveillance. Little is known about its transcriptome-wide targets. We used high-throughput sequencing after crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) in human cells to identify the binding sites of the DEAD-box helicase eIF4AIII, an EJC core component. CLIP reads form peaks mainly located in spliced mRNAs. Most expressed exons harbour peaks equally distributed between the canonical EJC region 24 nucleotides upstream of exonic junctions and other non-canonical regions. Unexpectedly, both are preferentially associated to unstructured and purine-rich sequences containing the motif GAAGA, a potential binding site of EJC-associated factors.

We have generated comprehensive catalogs of lncRNA species expressed in human and murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mapped their genomic origin. A surprisingly large fraction of these transcripts (>60%%) originate from divergent transcription at promoters of active protein-coding genes. The divergently transcribed lncRNA/mRNA gene pairs exhibit coordinated changes in transcription when ESCs are differentiated into endoderm. A significant number of the divergently transcribed lncRNAs/mRNA pairs are conserved between human and mouse ESCs. Disruption of promoter-associated lncRNA orthologs in a zebrafish model of early development causes gross developmental defects. Our results reveal that transcription of most lncRNA genes is coordinated with transcription of protein-coding genes and that these lncRNAs have roles in early development."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE41009GSE41166	A dynamic H3K27ac signature defines VEGF-regulated endothelial enhancers	"Histone modifications are now well-established regulators of transcriptional programs that distinguish distinct cell states. However, the kinetics of histone modification and their role in mediating rapid, signal-responsive changes in gene expression have been little studied on a genome-wide scale. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF), a major regulator of angiogenesis, rapidly triggers changes in transcriptional activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here we used chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to measure genome-wide changes in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), a marker of active enhancers {Kharchenko et al., 2011, Nature, 471, 480-5;Zentner et al., 2011, Genome Res, 21, 1273-83;Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011, Nature, 470, 279-83; Creyghton et al., 2010, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 107, 21931-6 }, after 0, 1, 4, and 12 hours of VEGF stimulation. We show that sites with greatest H3K27ac changes were associated tightly with p300, a histone acetyltransferase. This dynamic H3K27ac signature defined transcriptional elements that are functionally linked to angiogenesis, participate in rapid VEGF-stimulated changes in chromatin conformation, and mediate VEGF-induced transcriptional responses. Dynamic H3K27ac deposition required p300 activity and did not involve altered nucleosome occupancy. Our results demonstrate that capture of dynamic changes in H3K27ac provides a new approach to define the activity of functional genomic elements and implicate epigenetic modifications in rapid signal-responsive transcriptional regulation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE41166GSE41586	Expression data for HT29 cells treated with 5-aza-deoxy-cytidine [RNA-Seq]	"The RNA samples from HT-29 (ATCC) colon cancer cell line were reverse transcribed to build cDNA libraries and categorized into 3 groups with different concentrations of 5-aza-deoxy-cytidine (5-Aza); in each group three replicative 150 mm cultures were treated with: 1) dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle alone, 0 M 5-Aza); 2) 5M 5-Aza and 3) 10 M 5-Aza; for five days.

In order to better characterize CECs in different developmental stages, we profiled mRNA transcriptomes in human fetal and adult corneal endothelium with the goal to identify novel molecular markers in these cells. By comparing CECs with 12 other types of tissues, we identified 245 and 284 signature genes that are highly expressed in fetal and adult CECs, respectively. Functionally, these genes are characteristic of CECs, involving in cell adhesion, proteoglycan and sulfur metabolic process. Importantly, several of these genes are disease target genes in hereditary corneal dystrophies, consistent with their functional significance in CEC physiology. By comparing fetal and adult CECs, we also identified stage-specific markers associated with CEC maturation, such as the activation of the Wnt pathway genes in fetal, but not in adult CECs. Lastly, by immunohistochemistry of ocular tissues, we further confirmed the unique protein expression patterns for Wnt5a, S100A4, S100A6, and IER3, the four novel markers for either fetal or adult CECs.

To explore this issue, we performed a whole-genome and transcriptome analysis of 20 human iPSC lines derived from primary skin fibroblasts of 7 individuals using next-generation sequencing. We find that, on average, an iPSC line manifests two CNVs not apparent in the fibroblasts from which the iPSC was derived. Using qPCR, PCR, and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to amplify across the CNVs' breakpoints, we show that at least 50%% of those CNVs are present as low frequency somatic genomic variants in parental fibroblasts and are manifested in iPSC colonies due to their clonal origin. Hence, reprogramming does not necessarily lead to de novo CNVs in iPSC, since most of line-manifested CNVs reflect somatic mosaicism in the human skin. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that clonal expansion, and iPSC lines in particular, can be used as a discovery tool to reliably detect low frequency CNVs in the tissue of origin. Overall, we estimate that approximately 30%% of the fibroblast cells have somatic CNVs, suggesting widespread somatic mosaicism in the human body.

In differentiated cells, H1.5, but not H1.3, binds preferentially to genes that encode membrane and membrane-related proteins. Strikingly, 37%% of H1.5 target genes belong to gene family clusters, groups of homologous genes that are located in proximity to each other on chromosomes. H1.5 binding is associated with gene repression and is required for SIRT1 binding, H3K9me2 enrichment and chromatin compaction.

We report a combination of small molecules that induce up to 50%% motor neurons within 3 weeks from human pluripotent stem cells with defined subtype identities that are relevant to neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their accelerated differentiation, motor neurons expressed combinations of HB9, ISL1 and column-specific markers that mirror those observed in vivo in human fetal spinal cord. They also exhibited spontaneous and induced activity, and projected axons towards muscles when grafted into developing chick spinal cord. Strikingly, this novel protocol preferentially generates motor neurons expressing markers of limb-innervating lateral motor column motor neurons (FOXP1+/LHX3-).

These transcripts are processed, initially in aDICER-dependent fashion, into small RNAs (~28-65 nt) referred to as repeat-induced RNAs that cause the degradation of a subset of crucial stem-cell mRNAs, includingNanogmRNA, which modulate exit from the proliferative stem-cell state. This regulation requiresAGO3-dependent accumulation of processed DR2 Alu transcripts and the subsequent recruitment ofAGO3-associated decapping complexes to the target mRNA.

Besides its traditional role in regulated splicing, we show that PTB has a previously undocumented function in the regulation of microRNA functions, suppressing or enhancing microRNA targeting by competitive binding on target mRNA or altering local RNA secondary structure. A key event during neuronal induction is the relief of PTB-mediated blockage of microRNA action on multiple components of the REST complex, thereby de-repressing a large array of neuronal genes, including miR-124 and multiple neuronal-specific transcription factors, in non-neuronal cells.

Their definition relies on the presence of a centromere-specific H3 histone variant CenH3, known as CENP-A in mammals. Its overexpression in aggressive cancers raises questions concerning its effect on chromatin dynamics and contribution to tumorigenesis. We find that CenH3 overexpression in human cells leads to ectopic enrichment at sites of active histone turnover. Furthermore, in over-expressing conditions, we see the formation of a novel heterotypic particle (CenH3-H4/H3.3-H4) that occludes CTCF binding, but this occlusion has only a minor effect on gene expression. Ectopic localization and CTCF occlusion depends on the H3.3 chaperone DAXX, rather than its dedicated chaperone HJURP. This DAXX-dependent occlusion also occurs in naturally overexpressing cancer cells. Furthermore, our cellular model reveals a DAXX-dependent survival advantage when challenged by DNA damage.

To address this problem, the Hi-C method has been developed to identify long-range looping interactions in a genome-wide, unbiased fashion. However, current data analysis of Hi-C datasets cannot fully resolve regulatory interactions between enhancers and promoters due to the low resolution. Here, we generated a high-depth Hi-C dataset and applied a new analysis method that offers improved resolution permitting genome-wide identification of nearly one million chromatin interactions. We demonstrated the use of Hi-C to identify target promoters of enhancers regulated by NF-B signaling and signal-dependent dynamic chromatin interaction at these enhancers in human cells. Surprisingly, our results showed that most NF-B binding sites are looped to their regulatory targets prior to activation of the signaling pathway, and appear to undergo little change during signaling. This observation suggests that the chromatin organization landscape, once established in a cell type, is rather stable and may influence the selection and activation of target genes by a transcription factor."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43070GSE43093	Direct ChIP-bisulfite sequencing reveals a role of H3K27me3 mediating aberrant hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands in cancer cells (RNA-seq)	"Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of CpG island (CGI) promoters are associated with transcriptional repression of many tumor suppressor genes and lead to tumor progression in many cancers. Most recently, one research group observed that aberrantly hypermethylated genes in multiple cancers are already repressed, but their promoters are maintained in a hypomethylated state in pre-cancerous tissues.Their studies didn't provide a clue to explain by what mechanisms those genes were repressed in pre-cancerous tissues. Another research group found that many genes with de novo promoter hypermethylation in colon cancer were among the subset of genes 'bivalently' marked in embryonic stem cells and adult stem/progenitor cells by repressive Polycomb group proteins (PcG), which are known for maintaining low, but poised, transcription.These observations provide a clue that CGI promoter hypermethylation in cancers is associated with PcG target genes in pre-cancerous tissues.we took advantage of ChIP-BS-seq technology and applied it to examine H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 profiles for one normal lymphoblastoid cell line (YH) and three cancer cell lines including one cervical cancer cell line (Hela) and two gastric cancer (GC) cell lines (BGC-823 and AGS)."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43093GSE43143	RNA-Seq analysis of neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells reprogrammed from dental pulp	"In this study, we investigated its suitability for disease modeling by carrying out gene expression profiling, using RNA-seq, on neurons derived from iPSCs made from dental pulp extracted from deciduous teeth (T-iPSCs) and fibroblasts (F-iPSCs)."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43143GSE43296	Polysome-associated mRNA profiling of cancer cells in response to CXCL12 and IGF1	"CXCL12 and IGF1 are key secreting molecules produced by cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer.

The inflammatory response in human cells involves rapid and dramatic changes in gene expression, and the Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq techniques revealed a coordinated and complex regulation of gene expression both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The combinatory analysis of both RNA synthesis and stability using Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq allows for a much deeper understanding of mechanisms of gene regulation than afforded by the analysis of steadystate total RNA and should be useful in many biological settings."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43440GSE43520	The evolution of lncRNA repertoires and expression patterns in tetrapods	"Only a minuscule fraction of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are well characterized. The evolutionary history of lncRNAs can provide insights into their functionality, but comparative analyses have been precluded by our ignorance of lncRNAs in non-model organisms. Here, we use RNA sequencing to identify lncRNAs in eleven tetrapod species and we present the first large-scale evolutionary study of lncRNA repertoires and expression patterns. We identify ~11,000 primate- specific lncRNA families, which show evidence for selective constraint during recent evolution, and ~2,400 highly conserved lncRNAs (including ~400 genes that likely originated more than 300 million years ago). We find that lncRNAs, in particular ancient ones, are generally actively regulated and may predominantly function in embryonic development. lncRNA X-inactivation patterns reveal an extremely female-biased monotreme-specific lncRNA, which may partially compensate X-dosage in this lineage. Most lncRNAs evolve rapidly in terms of sequence and expression levels, but global patterns like tissue specificities are often conserved. We compared expression patterns of homologous lncRNA and protein-coding families across tetrapods to reconstruct an evolutionarily conserved co-expression network. This network, which surprisingly contains many lncRNA hubs, suggests potential functions for lncRNAs in fundamental processes like spermatogenesis or synaptic transmission, but also in more specific mechanisms such as placenta growth suppression through miRNA production."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43520GSE43526	Co-ordinate inhibition of autism candidate genes by topoisomerase inhibitors [Seq]	"Topoisomerases are necessary for the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, and are mutated in some patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have studied the effects of inhibitors of Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) and Topoisomerase 2 (Top2) enzymes on mouse cortical neurons. We find that topoisomerases selectively inhibit long genes (>100kb), with little effect on all other gene expression. Using ChIPseq against RNA Polymerase II (Pol2) we show that the Top1 inhibitor topotecan blocks transcriptional elongation of long genes specifically. Many of the genes inhibited by topotecan are candidate ASD genes, leading us to propose that topoisomerase inhibition might contribute to ASD pathology."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43526GSE43549	Heterokaryon RNA Sequencing	"We report the application of bi-species RNAseq for investigating mechanisms of reprogramming towards pluripotency using heterokaryons (mouse embryonic stem cell X human fibroblast cell fusions).

The functional relevance of these RNAs is largely unknown. To gain insight into the complexity of snoRNA processing and the functional relevance of snoRNA-derived small RNAs, we sequenced long and short RNAs, small RNAs that co-precipitate with the Argonaute 2 protein and RNA fragments obtained in photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of core snoRNA-associated proteins. Results: Analysis of these data sets revealed that many loci in the human genome reproducibly give rise to C/D box-like snoRNAs, whose expression and evolutionary conservation are typically less pronounced relative to the snoRNAs that are currently catalogued. We further found that virtually all C/D box snoRNAs are specifically processed inside the regions of terminal complementarity, retaining in the mature form only 4-5 nucleotides upstream of the C box and 2-5 nucleotides downstream of the D box. Sequencing of the total and Argonaute 2-associated populations of small RNAs revealed that despite their cellular abundance, C/D box-derived small RNAs are not efficiently incorporated into the Ago2 protein. Conclusions: We conclude that the human genome encodes a large number of snoRNAs that are processed along the canonical pathway and expressed at relatively low levels. Generation of snoRNA-derived processing products with alternative, particularly miRNA-like, functions appears to be uncommon."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43666GSE43726	RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in breast cancer cell lines after ectopic manipulation of miR-26a expression	RNA sequencing technology has been carried out in order to evaluate mRNA expression changes after manipulation of miR-26a in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43726GSE43770	Vitamin d receptor-mediated stromal reprogramming suppresses pancreatitis and enhances pancreatic cancer therapy	"The poor clinical outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been attributed to intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and a growth-permissive tumor microenvironment. Quiescent pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are neuroendocrine, nestin-positive, lipid-accumulating cells whose homologues in the liver are the principal repository of Vitamin A esters. Upon activation, lipid droplets are lost and via transdifferentiation they become the key cell type responsible for driving the severe desmoplasia that characterizes PDA. Despite their critical role in PDA progression and chemoresistance, therapeutic strategies targeting PSCs are lacking. Here we identified the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a master genomic regulator of PSC activation and function. In vitro we demonstrate that VDR activation reduces expression in PSCs of genes implicated in activation, inflammation, and extracellular matrix production, as well as restoring lipid droplet integrity. In vivo, the VDR ligand calcipotriol enhances the anti-tumor effects of gemcitabine by increasing intratumoral concentration 5-fold, reducing tumor volume to near baseline and lowering metastases by more than 65%%.

Here we redefine AREs by motif-resolution AR chromatin immunoprecipitation-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) assay in human prostate cancer cells and tumors. Surprisingly, we find that, in addition to canonical full-length AREs and half-site-like AREs, a significant portion of the four redefined ARE categories comprises non-canonical full-length AREs. The redefined AREs in enhanced AR binding regions in prostate tumors versus paired non-malignant adjacent tissues regulate a prostate cancer-relevant gene network not only centered on AR, but more interestingly, on novel AR target genes mTOR, BIRC5 and BCL2L1 involved in prostate cancer cell growth and survival.

In contrast, here we showed that the physiological vascular permeability that precedes implantation is directly controlled by progesterone receptor (PR) and it is independent of VEGF. Both global and endothelial-specific deletion of PR block physiological vascular permeability in the uterus while misexpression of PR in the endothelium of other organs results in ectopic vascular leakage. Integration of genome-wide transcriptional profile of endothelium and ChIP-sequencing revealed that PR induces a NR4A1 (Nur77/TR3) specific transcriptional program that broadly regulates vascular permeability in response to progesterone. This program triggers concurrent suppression of several junctional proteins and leads to an effective, timely and venule-specific regulation of vascular barrier function. Silencing NR4A1 blocks PR-mediated permeability responses indicating a direct link between PR and NR4A1.

In conjunction with biochemical and leukemia pathological studies, the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses of the AETFC components in leukemic cells reveal that these components stabilize the complex through multivalent interactions, provide multiple DNA-binding domains for diverse target genes, colocalize genome-wide, cooperatively regulate gene expression, and contribute to leukemogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43834GSE43984	"Transcriptome analysis of human sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatocyte"	"We report the transcriptome human primary hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.

Through single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), we report here a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome dynamics from oocyte to morula in both human and mouse embryos. Based on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in blastomere mRNAs and paternal-specific SNPs, we identify novel stage-specific monoallelic expression patterns for a significant portion of polymorphic gene transcripts (25-53%%). By weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we find that each developmental stage can be concisely delineated by a small number of functional modules of co-expressed genes. This result indicates a sequential order of transcriptional changes in pathways of cell cycle, gene regulation, translation, and metabolism in a step-wise fashion from cleavage to morula. Cross-species comparisons reveal that the majority of human stage-specific modules (7 out of 9) are remarkably preserved, only to diverge in developmental specificity and timing in mice. We further identify conserved key members (or hub genes) of the human and mouse networks. These genes represent novel candidates that are likely key players in driving mammalian preimplantation development. Collectively, we demonstrate that mammalian preimplantation development is orchestrated by evolutionarily conserved genetic programs that diverge in developmental timing.

The boundary sequences are enriched for binding sites of CTCF and the cohesin complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of topological domains. To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher order chromatin architecture in human cells, we proteolytically cleaved the cohesin complex from interphase chromatin and examined changes in chromosomal organization as well as transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromosomal interactions upon disruption of cohesin complex, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of CTCF by RNA interference in these cells not only reduced intra-domain interactions but also increased inter-domain interactions. Further more, distinct groups of genes become mis-regulated upon depletion of cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin contribute in different ways to chromatin organization and gene regulation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE44267GSE44450	Stranded RNA-seq of H9 cells	We have used stranded RNA-seq to explore RNA editing in H9 cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE44450GSE44457	Cellular generation of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine by redox-active chemicals via an unprecedent non-enzymatic mechanism	"We proposed that besides TET family dioxygenase oxidizing 5mC to 5hmC, there is a non-enzyme pathway which is due to hydroxyl radica l(OH) or OH-like species also involvement in demethylation of 5mC forming 5hmC.

One such gene, TCF21, encodes a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor believed to serve a critical role in the development of epicardial progenitor cells that give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC) and cardiac fibroblasts. Using reporter gene and immunolocalization studies with mouse and human tissues we have found that vascular TCF21 expression in the adult is restricted primarily to adventitial cells associated with coronary arteries and also medial SMC in the proximal aorta of mouse. Genome wide RNA-Seq studies in human coronary artery SMC (HCASMC) with siRNA knockdown found a number of putative TCF21 downstream pathways identified by enrichment of terms related to CAD, including vascular disease, disorder of artery, and occlusion of artery as well as disease-related cellular functions including cellular movement, and cellular growth and proliferation. In vitro studies in HCASMC demonstrated that TCF21 expression promotes proliferation and migration and inhibits SMC lineage marker expression. Detailed in situ expression studies with reporter gene and lineage tracing revealed that vascular wall cells expressing Tcf21 before disease initiation migrate into vascular lesions of ApoE-/- and Ldlr-/- mice. While Tcf21 lineage traced cells are distributed throughout the early lesions, in mature lesions they contribute to the formation of a subcapsular layer of cells, and others become associated with the fibrous cap. The lineage traced fibrous cap cells activate expression of SMC markers and growth factor receptor genes. Taken together, these data suggest that TCF21 may have a role regulating the differentiation state of SMC precursor cells that migrate into vascular lesions and contribute to the fibrous cap and more broadly, in view of the association of this gene with human CAD, provide evidence that these processes may be a mechanism for CAD risk attributable to the vascular wall."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE44461GSE44585	RNA helicase A is necessary for KIF1B tumor suppression in neuroblastoma	"During development neuronal progenitors compete for growth factors such as nerve growth factor NGF and require the prolyl hydroxylase EglN3 and the kinesin KIF1B for developmental apoptosis.

We found that KIF1B interacts with the RNA helicase A (DHX9) resulting in DHX9 nuclear accumulation to regulate apoptosis.

In vitro and in vivo, LIN28 preferentially bound single-stranded RNA containing a uridine-rich element and one or more flanking guanosines, and appeared to be able to disrupt base-pairing to access these elements when embedded in predicted secondary structure. In HEK293 cells, LIN28 protein binding mildly stabilized target mRNAs and increased protein abundance. The top targets were its own mRNAs and those of other RBPs and cell-cycle regulators.

The integrity of this epithelium and its ability to act as a selective barrier are critical for normal lung function. In other epithelia there is evidence that transcription factors of the evolutionarily conserved grainyheadlike (GRHL) family play key roles in co-ordinating the expression of numerous proteins required for epithelial morphogenesis, differentiation, remodeling and repair. However, little is known about their function in the adult lung. Here, we focus on the role of GRHL2 in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, using either shRNA or a dominant negative protein (DN-GRHL2) to inhibit its function. We follow changes in epithelial phenotype, and in gene transcription using RNA-seq or microarray analysis, both in undifferentiated basal cells and in cells differentiating in air-liquid interface culture into a mucociliary epithelium with transepithelial electrical resistance. We identify several hundreds of genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by GRHL2. Using ChIP-seq to map sites of GRHL2 binding in the basal cells we identify 7,687 potential primary targets, and confirm that GRHL2 binding is strongly enriched near GRHL-regulated genes. Different subsets of the large cohort of potential GRHL2 targets appear to be active in basal and differentiated cells. Taken together, the results strongly support the hypothesis that GRHL2 plays a key role in regulating many physiological functions of human airway epithelium, including those involving cell adhesion, polarity and morphogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE44718GSE44866	Classification of cancer cell lines using a promoter-targeted liquid hybridization capture-based bisulfite sequencing approach	"DNA methylation plays a significant role in assuring cell identity, thus potentiating its application in molecular classification of cancers in respect of tissue origins or clinically and aetiologically distinct subtypes.

We detected ten cell lines originated from different tissue origins and demonstrated a similar potentiality of promoter methylomes as classifiers for cancer cell lines from different tissue origins in comparison with gene expression profiles. Furthermore, promoter methylome can sensitively differentiate two different cell lines from the same tissue origin in respect of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), as in the case of AGS and BGC-823 gastric cancer cell lines.

Analysis of the data sets allowed the identification of hundreds of lncRNAs exhibiting differentiation stage-specific expression patterns. As a first step in characterizing these lncRNAs, we focus on an endoderm-specific lncRNA DEANR1 (Definitive Endoderm Associated long Non-coding RNA1) and demonstrate that it plays an important role in human endoderm differentiation. DEANR1 contributes to endoderm differentiation by positively regulating endoderm factor FOXA2 expression. Importantly, overexpression of FOXA2 is able to rescue endoderm differentiation defects caused by DEANR1 depletion. Mechanistically, DEANR1 facilitates FOXA2 activation by helping SMAD2/3 recruitment to the FOXA2 promoter.

We observed significant RBM10-RNA interactions in the vicinity of splice sites and identified hundreds of splicing changes following perturbation of cellular RBM10 abundance. A RNA splicing map integrating the binding pattern and splicing profiles revealed a significant correlation between RBM10-enhanced exon skipping events and its binding close to the splicing sites of both upstream and downstream introns. Furthermore, we demonstrated the splicing defects in a patient carrying a RBM10 mutation. Overall, our data provided insights into the mechanistic model of RBM10-mediated splicing regulation and established genomic resources for future studies on its function in different pathophysiological contexts."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE44976GSE45133	Breakpoint analysis of transcriptional and genomic profiles uncovers novel gene fusions spanning multiple human cancer types (RNA-seq)	"We report the design and implementation of a 'breakpoint analysis' pipeline to discover novel gene fusions by tell-tale transcript level or genomic DNA copy number transitions occurring within genes. We use this method to prioritize candidate rearrangements from high density array CGH datasets as well as exon-resolution expression microarrays. We mine both publicly available data as well as datasets generated in our laboratory. Several gene fusion candidates were chosen for further characterization, and corresponding samples were profiled using paired end RNA sequencing to discover the identity of the gene fusion. Using this approach, we report the discovery and characterization of novel gene fusions spanning multiple cancer subtypes including angiosarcoma, pancreatic cancer, anaplastic astrocytoma, melanoma, breast cancer, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Taken together, this study provides a robust approach for gene fusion discovery, and our results highlight a more widespread role of fusion genes in cancer pathogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45133GSE45144	Genome-wide Analysis of Transcriptional Regulators in Human Blood Stem/Progenitor Cells reveals a densely interconnected network of coding and non-coding genes.	"Combinatorial transcription factor (TF) interactions regulate hematopoietic stem cell formation, maintenance and differentiation, and are increasingly recognised as drivers of stem cell signatures in cancer. However, genome-wide combinatorial binding patterns for key regulators do not exist in primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and have constrained analysis of the global architecture of the molecular circuits controlling these cells. Here we provide new high-resolution genome-wide binding maps of seven key TFs (FLI1, ERG, GATA2, RUNX1, SCL, LYL1 and LMO2) in human CD34+ HSPCs together with quantitative RNA and microRNA expression profiles. We catalogue binding of TFs at coding genes and microRNA promoters and report that combinatorial binding of all seven TFs is favoured and is associated with differential expression of genes and microRNA in HSPCs. We also uncover a hitherto unrecognized association between FLI1 and RUNX1 pairing in HSPCs, establish a correlation between the density of histone modifications, which mark active enhancers and the number of overlapping TFs at a peak and identify complex relationships between specific miRNAs and coding genes regulated by the heptad. Taken together, this study demonstrates that a heptad of TFs forms a dense auto-regulatory core in human HSPCs with binding of all seven TFs at tissue specific regulatory elements of heptad genes and collectively regulates miRNAs that in turn target components of the heptad and genes regulated by the heptad."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45144GSE45157	Trans-chromosomal regulation by a novel lincRNA required for adipogenesis that escapes X-chromosome inactivation	"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an important layer of genome regulation with common mechanistic themes including the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes. Here, we present a novel X-linked lncRNA termed linc-Firre that escapes X-chromosome inactivation and forms trans-chromosomal interactions required for adipogenesis. Linc-Firre is exclusively nuclear and forms punctate expression foci on chromatin near its site of transcription on both X-chromosomes in human and mouse. Both the localization of linc-Firre and the association with the nuclear matrix protein hnRNPU require a conserved repeating RNA domain, R2D2. Collectively, these results reveal a lincRNA that escapes X-chromosome inactivation with a critical role in driving cell fate decisions by trans-chromosomal interactions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45157GSE45159	Genetic regulation of human adipose microRNA expression and its consequences for metabolic traits	"The genetics of messenger RNA expression has been extensively studied in humans and other organisms, but little is known about genetic factors contributing to microRNA (miRNA) expression. We examined natural variation of miRNA expression in adipose tissue in a population of 200 men who have been carefully characterized for metabolic syndrome phenotypes as part of the METSIM study. We genotyped the subjects using high-density SNP microarrays and quantified the mRNA abundance using genome-wide expression arrays and miRNA abundance using next generation sequencing. We reliably quantified 356 miRNA species that were expressed in human adipose tissue, a limited number of which made up most of the expressed miRNAs. We mapped the miRNA abundance as an expression quantitative trait and determined cis regulation of expression for 9 of the miRNAs and of the processing of one miRNA (miR-28). The degree of genetic variation of miRNA expression was substantially less than that of mRNAs. For the majority of the miRNAs, genetic regulation of expression was independent of the host mRNA transcript expression. We also showed that for 108 miRNAs, mapped reads displayed widespread variation from the canonical sequence. We found a total of 24 miRNAs to be significantly associated with metabolic syndrome traits. We suggest a regulatory role for miR-204-5p which was predicted to inhibit ACACB, a key fatty acid oxidation enzyme that has been shown to play a role in regulating body fat and insulin resistance in adipose tissue."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45159GSE45176	"RNA-seq expression analysis to determine expression profile similarities between fibroblasts, induced endothelial cells from fibroblasts, and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells"	"The goal of this study was to determine the similarity between human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, induced endothelial cells from fibroblasts, and fibroblasts through RNA-seq expression analysis.

Through profiling the genomic licalizations of AR and its co-regulators FOXA1 and TCF7L2 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, we revealed the molecular details of the AR-centered regulatory network. We further identified that c-MYC is a key downstream target co-regulated by AR, FOXA1 and TCF7L2, and reinforces the transctiopnal activation of androgen-responsive genes in this subtype of breast cancers."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45202GSE45258	"RNA-seq analysis of HT-29, MCF10A, and MDA-MB-436 cells"	"RNA-seq data from HT-29 cells treated with IFN- for 24 hr, MCF10A cells, and MDA-MB-436 cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45258GSE45263	Increased Neanderthal ancestry in genomic regions associated with lipid catabolism in contemporary Europeans	"While Neanderthals are extinct, fragments of their genome still persist in the genomes of contemporary humans. Here, we show that such Neanderthal-like sequences are not distributed randomly in contemporary human genomes. Specifically, while genome-wide frequency of Neanderthal-like sites is close to 6%% in all out-of-Africa populations, genes involved in lipid catabolism contain large excess Neanderthal-like sequences in Europeans (24.3%%), but not in Asians (12.4%%). While lipid catabolism cannot be assayed in Neanderthals, we took advantage of genetic divergence between human populations, chimpanzees and Neanderthals to predict metabolic divergence expected from the observed excess of Neanderthal gene flow into Europeans. We confirmed predicted changes in lipid catabolism using hydrophobic metabolome measurements in the brain tissue and further linked these metabolic changes to gene expression divergence."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45263GSE45326	Identification of expressed and conserved human non-coding RNAs	"Methods: RNA profiles of 12 tissues were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

Results: Eighty million paired-end Illumina reads and ~500,000 tandem mass spectra were used to identify 12,873 transcripts (19,320 including isoforms) and 6,810 proteins.

Here, we show that SFMBT1 regulates transcription in somatic cells and during spermatogenesis through the formation of a stable complex with LSD1 and CoREST. When bound to its gene targets, SFMBT1 recruits its associated proteins and causes chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression. SFMBT1, LSD1, and CoREST share a large fraction of target genes including those encoding replication-dependent histones. Simultaneous occupancy of histone genes by SFMBT1, LSD1, and CoREST is regulated during the cell cycle and correlates with the loss of RNA polymerase II at these promoters during G2, M, and G1. The interplay between the repressive SFMBT1LSD1CoREST complex and RNA polymerase II contributes to the timely transcriptional regulation of histone genes in human cells. SFMBT1, LSD1, and CoREST also form a stable complex in germ cells and their chromatin binding activity is regulated during spermatogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45442GSE45453	Differences in gastric carcinoma microenvironment stratify according to EBV infection intensity; implications for possible immune adjuvant therapy	Our goal of this study was to perform quantitative and global assessment of EBV gene expression in gastric carcinomas and assess EBV associated cellular pathway alterations.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45453GSE45504	Muscleblind-like proteins regulate embryonic stem cell-specific alternative splicing and reprogramming II	"Previous investigations of the core gene regulatory circuitry that controls embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency have largely focused on the roles of transcription, chromatin and non- coding RNA regulators. Alternative splicing (AS) represents a widely acting mode of gene regulation, yet its role in the regulation of ESC pluripotency and differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we identify the Muscleblind-like RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, as conserved and direct negative regulators of a large program of AS events that are differentially regulated between ESCs and other cell types. Knockdown of MBNL proteins in differentiated cells causes switching to an ESC-like AS pattern for at least half of these AS events. Among the events is an ESC-specific AS switch in the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP1 that controls pluripotency. Consistent with a central and negative regulatory role for MBNL proteins in pluripotency, their knockdown significantly enhances the expression of key pluripotency genes and the formation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) during somatic cell reprogramming."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45504GSE45669	"RNA-sequencing of the human milk fat layer during colostrum, transitional, and mature stages of lactation"	"Human milk fat globules, by enveloping cell contents during their secretion into milk, are a rich source of mammary cell RNA. Here, we pair this non-invasive mRNA source with RNA sequencing technology to probe the milk fat layer transcriptome during three stages of lactation: colostral, transitional, and mature milk production. We find that transcriptional profiles cluster not by postpartum day, but by milk Na:K ratio, indicating that women sampled during the same postpartum time frame could be at markedly different stages of gene expression. Each stage of lactation is characterized by a dynamic range (105-fold) in transcript abundances not previously observed with microarray technology. We discovered that transcripts for isoferritins and cathepsins are strikingly abundant during colostrum production, highlighting the potential importance of these proteins for neonatal health. Two transcripts, encoding -casein (CSN2) and a-lactalbumin (LALBA), make up 45%% of the total pool of mRNA in mature lactation. Genes significantly expressed across all stages of lactation are associated with making, modifying, transporting, and packaging milk proteins. Stage-specific transcripts are associated with immune defense during the colostral stage, up-regulation of the machinery needed for milk protein synthesis during the transitional stage, and the production of lipids during mature lactation. We observed strong modulation of key genes involved in lactose synthesis and insulin signaling. In particular, PTPRF may serve as a biomarker linking insulin resistance with insufficient milk supply. This study provides the methodology and reference data set to enable future targeted research on the physiological contributors to sub-optimal lactation in humans."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45669GSE45732	Gene expression analysis of breast cancer cell-lines	"Recurrent mutations in histone modifying enzymes in multiple cancer types imply key roles in tumorigenesis. However, the functional relevance of these mutations remains unknown. Here we show that the JARID1B histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase is frequently amplified and overexpressed in luminal breast tumors and a somatic point mutation of JARID1B leads to the gain of luminal-specific gene expression programs. Downregulation of JARID1B in luminal breast cancer cells induces the expression of basal cell-specific genes and growth arrest, which is partially rescued by the inhibition of TGFBR thereby indicating a key role for TGFb signaling. Integrated genome-wide analysis of JARID1B chromatin binding, histone H3 lysine trimethyl (H3K4me3) and dimethyl (H3K4me2) patterns, and gene expression profiles in luminal and basal-like breast cancer cells suggest a key role for JARID1B in luminal cell-specific gene expression programs. A significant fraction of JARID1B binding-sites overlaps with CTCF in both luminal and basal-like breast cancer cells. CTCF also co-immunoprecipitates with JARID1B and it may influence its histone demethylase (HDM) activity as the H3K4me3/me2 ratio is lower at the CTCF-overlapping compared to JARID1B-unique sites. Additionally, a heterozygous JARID1B missense mutation (K1435R) in the HCC2157 basal-like breast cancer cell line is associated with unique JARID1B chromatin-binding and gene expression patterns implying gain of luminal features. In line with this, exogenous expression of this mutant in basal-like breast cancer cells leads to a gain of JARID1B binding at many luminal-specific genes. A PARADIGM score reflecting JARID1B activity in luminal breast cancer cells is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with luminal breast tumors. Together, our data imply that JARID1B is a luminal lineage-driving oncogene and that its therapeutic targeting may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in treatment-resistant luminal breast tumors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45732GSE45785	"Transcriptome-profiling (RNA-seq) and Ribosome-profiling (Ribo-seq) of BJ cells treated with Nutlin-3a, an MDM2 inhibitor, which induces p53."

This method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulfate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues9, followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known mRNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome10. Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast reveals that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding, thermodynamics play an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo. We use Dimethyl Sulfate to probe the structure of rRNA and mRNA in yeast in vivo, in vitro, and at different temperatures in vitro. We obtain a great agreement between in vivo data and known mRNA structures as well as the ribosome crystal structure. We find that in contrast to ribosomal rna, mRNAs are less structured in vivo than in vitro, and the structures present in vivo can only partially be explained by thermodynamic stability. In addition, we identify new regulatory structures present in vivo."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45803GSE45822	Functional Importance of eRNAs for Estrogen-dependent Gene Transcriptional Activation	"The functional importance of gene enhancers in regulated gene expression is well established. In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs referred to as eRNAs are present on enhancers. However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional, or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Here, we report that 17 -estradiol (E2)-bound estrogen receptor alpha (ER) on enhancers causes a global increase in eRNA transcription on enhancers adjacent to E2 upregulated coding genes. These induced eRNAs, as functional transcripts, appear to exert important roles for the observed ligand-dependent induction of target coding genes, causing an increased strength of specific enhancer:promoter looping initiated by ER binding. Cohesin, present on many ER-regulated enhancers even prior to ligand treatment, apparently contributes to E2-dependent gene activation by stabilizing E2/ER/eRNA-induced enhancer:promoter looping. Our data indicate that eRNAs are likely to exert important functions in many regulated programs of gene transcription."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45822GSE45982	EZH2 is required for germinal center formation and somatic EZH2 mutations promote lymphoid transformation	"The EZH2 histone methyltransferase is highly expressed in germinal center (GC) B-cells and targeted by somatic mutations in B-cell lymphomas. Here we find that EZH2 deletion or pharmacologic inhibition suppresses GC formation and functions in mice. EZH2 represses proliferation checkpoint genes and helps establish bivalent chromatin domains at key regulatory loci to transiently suppress GC B-cell differentiation. Somatic mutations reinforce these physiological effects through enhanced silencing of EZH2 targets in B-cells, and in human B-cell lymphomas. Conditional expression of mutant EZH2 in mice induces GC hyperplasia and accelerated lymphomagenesis in cooperation with BCL2. GCB-type DLBCLs are mostly addicted to EZH2, regardless of mutation status, but not the more differentiated ABC-type DLBCLs, thus clarifying the therapeutic scope of EZH2 targeting."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45982GSE46030	Selective demethylation and altered gene expression are associated with ICF Syndrome in human induced pluripotent stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells	"Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability, and Facial Anomalies Type I (ICF1) Syndrome is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in DNMT3B, a de novo DNA methyltransferase. However, the molecular basis of how DNMT3B-deficiency leads to ICF1 pathogenesis is unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology facilitates the study of early human developmental diseases via facile in vitro paradigms. Here, we generate iPSCs from ICF Type 1 Syndrome patient fibroblasts followed by directed differentiation of ICF1-iPSCs to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). By performing genome-scale bisulfite sequencing, we find that DNMT3B-deficient iPSCs exhibit global loss of non-CG methylation and select CG hypomethylation at gene promoters and enhancers. Further unbiased scanning of ICF1 iPSC methylomes also identifies large megabase regions of CG hypomethylation typically localized in centromeric and subtelomeric regions. RNA sequencing of ICF1 and control iPSCs revealsabnormal gene expression in ICF1 iPSCs relevant to ICF Syndrome phenotypes, some directly associated with promoter or enhancer hypomethylation. Upon differentiation of ICF1 iPSCs to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), we find virtually all CG hypomethylated regions remained hypomethylated when compared to either wild-type iPSC-derived MSCs or primary bone-marrow MSCs. Collectively, our results show specific methylome and transcriptome defects in both ICF1-iPSCs and differentiated somatic cell lineages, providing a valuable stem cell system for further in vitro study of the molecular pathogenesis of ICF1 Syndrome."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46030GSE46044	"A compendium of hematopoietic regulators, chromatin modifiers and basal transcription factors occupy CBF-MYH11/RUNX1 target genes"	"Different mechanisms for CBF-MYH11 function in acute myeloid Leukemia (AML) with inv(16) have been proposed such as tethering of RUNX1 outside the nucleus, interference with transcription factor complex assembly and recruitment of histone deacetylases, all resulting in transcriptional repression of RUNX1 target genes. Here, through genome-wide CBF-MYH11 binding site analysis and quantitative interaction proteomics we found that CBF-MYH11 localizes to RUNX1 occupied promoters where it interacts with TAL1, FLI1 and TBP associated factors (TAFs) in the context of the hematopoietic transcription factors ERG, GATA2 and PU.1/SPI1 and the co regulators EP300 and HDAC1. Transcriptional analysis revealed that upon fusion protein knock down a subset of the CBF-MYH11 target genes show increased expression, confirming a role in transcriptional repression. However, the majority of CBF-MYH11 target genes, including genes implicated in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal such as ID1, LMO1 and JAG1, are actively transcribed and upon fusion protein knock down repressed. Together these results suggest an essential role for CBF-MYH11 in regulating expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell phenotype."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46044GSE46056	RNAseq of PRMT4KD in human cord blood derived CD34+ cells	"Defining the role of epigenetic regulators in normal hematopoiesis has become critically important, as recurrent mutations or aberrant expression of these genes has been identified in both myeloid and lymphoid hematological malignancies. We have found that PRMT4, a type I arginine methyltransferase, whose function in normal and malignant hematopoiesis is unknown, is overexpressed in AML patient samples. In support of an oncogenic role for PRMT4, we find that its overexpression blocks the myeloid differentiation of human stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) while its knockdown (KD) is sufficient to induce myeloid differentiation of HSPCs and multiple AML cell lines. Although classically thought of as a co-activator, we found that PRMT4 functions to repress the expression of miR-223 in HSPCs via the methylation of RUNX1, which triggers the assembly of a multi-protein repressor complex that includes DPF2. As part of a feedback loop, PRMT4 expression is repressed post-transcriptionally by miR-223 during the normal differentiation process. These data reveal an unidentified role of PRMT4 in myeloid differentiation and its unexpected repressive role in transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, depletion of PRMT4 results in the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells in vitro and their decrease proliferation in vivo. Thus, targeting PRMT4 holds potential as a novel therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46056GSE46130	Transcriptional and Epigenetic Dynamics During Specification of Human Embryonic Stem Cells	"Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provides a unique opportunity to study the epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate cellular transitions in a human context. To that end, we performed comprehensive transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of early populations derived through directed differentiation of hESCs representing each of the three embryonic germ layers. Integration of whole genome bisulfite sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and RNA-Sequencing reveals unique events associated with specification towards each lineage. While we observe expected dynamics such as loss of DNA methylation and gain of H3K4me1 at distal putative regulatory elements, we frequently found a germ layer specific switch to H3K27me3 at sites of high DNA methylation in the undifferentiated state.

Tissue and cell specific transcriptome changes during pathophysiological stress, in disease cases versus controls and in response to therapies are of particular interest to investigators studying cardiometabolic diseases. Thus, knowledge on the relationships between sequencing depth and detection of transcriptomic variation is needed for designing RNA-Seq experiments and for interpreting results of analyses. Using deeply sequenced RNA-Seq data derived from adipose of a healthy individual before and after systemic administration of endotoxin (LPS), we investigated the sequencing depths needed for studies of gene expression and alternative splicing (AS). We found that to detect expressed genes and AS events, ~100 million (M) filtered reads were needed. However, the requirement on sequencing depth for the detection of LPS modulated differential expression (DE) and differential alternative splicing (DAS) was much higher. To detect 80%% of events, ~300M filtered reads were needed for DE analysis whereas at least 400M filtered reads were necessary for detecting DAS. Although the majority of expressed genes and AS events can be detected with modest sequencing depths (~100M filtered reads), the estimated gene expression levels and exon/intron inclusion levels were less accurate. We report the first study that evaluates the relationship between RNA-Seq depth and the ability to detect DE and DAS in human adipose. Our results suggest that a much higher sequencing depth is needed to reliably identify DAS events than for DE genes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46323GSE46486	Age-related methylation changes are associated with altered transcriptional circuitry [RNA-seq]	"Altered DNA methylation patterns represent an attractive mechanism for the phenotypic changes associated with human aging. Several studies have described age-related methylation changes to various extents, but their functional significance has remained largely unclear. We have now used an integrated methylome and transcriptome sequencing approach to characterize age-related methylation changes in the human epidermis and to analyze their impact on gene expression. Our results show limited and localized methylation differences between young and old methylomes at single-base resolution. Similarly, the comparison of transcriptomes from young and old samples revealed a highly defined set of differentially expressed genes with functional annotations in skin homeostasis. Further data analysis showed a robust correlation between age-related promoter hypermethylation and gene silencing, particularly at promoters that were pre-marked with stem cell-specific chromatin features. In addition, we also observed age-related methylation changes at transcription factor binding sites, with a significant enrichment of stem cell regulatory networks. Our results provide a high-resolution analysis of age-related methylation changes and suggest that they result in highly defined alterations in the transcriptional programme of the human epidermis.

To determine the contribution of progesterone in the endothelium, we have characterized and validated an in vitro culture system in which human umbilical vein endothelial cells constitutively express human progesterone receptor (PR). Using next generation RNA-sequencing, we identified a selective group of cytokines that are suppressed by progesterone both under physiological conditions and during pathological activation by lipopolysaccharide. In particular, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL2/3, and CXCL1 were found to be direct targets of PR, as determined by ChIP-sequencing. Regulation of these cytokines by progesterone was also confirmed by bead-based multiplex cytokine assays and quantitative PCR. These findings provide a novel role for PR in the direct regulation of cytokine levels secreted by the endothelium.

We have compared and contrasted two methods to identify targets of viral miRNAs in order to identify the advantages and limitations of each method to aid in uncovering the functions of EBV's miRNAs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46514GSE46523	Whole transcriptome RNA-seq of undiseased human prefrontal cortex	"We report the application of high-throughput RNA sequencing to the human prefrontal cortex.

Several genes in the deleted region have been implicated in the development of SZ, e.g., PRODH and DGCR8. However, the mechanistic connection between these genes and the neuropsychiatric phenotype remains unclear. To elucidate the molecular consequences of 22q11.2 deletion in early neural development, we carried out RNA-seq analysis to investigate gene expression in differentiating human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of 22q11.2 DS SZ and SAD patients. Eight cases (ten iPSC-neuron samples in total including duplicate clones) and seven controls (nine in total including duplicate clones) were subject to RNA sequencing. Using a systems level analysis, differentially expressed genes/gene-modules and pathway of interests were identified. We observed ~2-fold reduction in expression of almost all genes in the 22q11.2 region in SZ (37 genes reached p-value < 0.05, 36 of which reached a false discovery rate < 0.05). Outside of the deleted region, 745 genes showed significant differences in expression between SZ and control neurons (p<0.05). Function enrichment and network analysis of the differentially expressed genes uncovered converging evidence on abnormal expression in key functional pathways, such as apoptosis, cell cycle and survival, and MAPK signaling in the SZ and SAD samples."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46562GSE46579	A blood based 12-miRNA signature of Alzheimer patients	"We applied Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to miRNAs from blood samples of 48 AD (Alzheimer's Disease) patients and 22 unaffected controls, yielding a total of 140 unique mature miRNAs with significantly changed expression level. Of these, 82 were higher and 58 lower abundant in samples from AD patients. We selected a panel of 12 miRNAs for a qRT-PCR analysis on a larger cohort of 202 samples including not only AD patients and healthy controls but also patients with other CNS illnesses: Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Major Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Mild Cognitive Impairment, which is assumed to represent a transitional period before the development of AD. MiRNA target enrichment analysis of the selected 12 miRNAs indicated an involvement of miRNAs in nervous system development, neuron projection, neuron projection development, and neuron projection morphogenesis, respectively. Using this 12-miRNA signature we were able to differentiate between AD and controls with an accuracy of 93.3%%, a specificity of 95.1%%, and a sensitivity of 91.5%%. The differentiation of AD from other neurological diseases was possible with accuracies between 73.8%% and 77.8%%.

Elongation pausing is deemed highly relevant to co-translational folding of nascent peptides and the functionality of protein products, which positioned the evaluation of elongation speed as one of the central questions in the field of translational control. By employing three types of RNA-seq methods, we experimentally and computationally resolved elongation speed at individual gene level and under physiological condition in human cells. We proposed the elongation velocity index (EVI) as a relative measure and successfully distinguished slow-translating genes from the background translatome. The proteins encoded by the low-EVI genes are more stable than the proteome background. In normal cell and lung cancer cell comparisons, we found that the relatively slow-translating genes are relevant to the maintenance of malignant phenotypes. In addition, we identified cell-specific slow-translating codons, which may serve as a causal factor of elongation deceleration."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46613GSE46665	Identification of differentially expressed transcripts and pathways one week and six months following implant of left ventricular devices	"A specific set of genes involved in regulating cellular immune response, antigen presentation, and T cell activation and survival were down-regulated 7 days after LVAD placement. 6 months following LVAD placement, the expression levels of these genes were significantly increased; yet importantly, remained significantly lower than age and sex-matched samples from healthy controls."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46665GSE46876	The ABRF Next-Generation Sequencing Study (ABRF-NGS): Multi-platform and cross-methodological reproducibility of transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq.	"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology applications like RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) have dramatically expanded the potential for novel genomics discoveries, but the proliferation of various platforms and protocols for RNA-seq has created a need for reference data sets to help gauge the performance characteristics of these disparate methods. Here we describe the results of the ABRF-NGS Study on RNA-seq, which leverages replicate experiments across multiple sites using two reference RNA standards tested with four protocols (polyA selected, ribo-depleted, size selected, and degraded RNA), and examined across five NGS platforms (Illuminas HiSeqs, Life Technologies Personal Genome Machine and Proton, Roche 454 GS FLX, and Pacific Biosciences RS). These results show high (R2 >0.9) intra-platform consistency across test sites, high inter-platform concordance (R2 >0.8) for transcriptome profiling, and a large set of novel splice junctions observed across all platforms. Also, we observe that protocols using ribosomal RNA depletion can both salvage degraded RNA samples and also be readily compared to polyA-enriched fractions. These data provide a broad foundation for standardization, evaluation and improvement of RNA-seq methods."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46876GSE46908	Identification of LIN28-bound mRNAs reveals features of target recognition and regulation	"The conserved human LIN28 RNA-binding proteins function in development, maintenance of pluripotency and oncogenesis. We used PAR-CLIP and a newly developed variant of this method, iDo-PAR-CLIP, to identify LIN28B targets as well as sites bound by the individual RNA binding domains of LIN28B in the human transcriptome at nucleotide resolution. The position of target binding sites reflected the known structural relative orientation of individual LIN28B binding domains, validating iDo-PAR-CLIP. Our data suggest that LIN28B directly interacts with most expressed mRNAs and members of the let-7 microRNA family. The Lin28 binding motif detected in pre-let-7 was enriched in mRNA sequences bound by LIN28B. Upon LIN28B knock down, cell proliferation and the cell cycle were strongly impaired. Quantitative shotgun proteomics of LIN28B depleted cells revealed significant reduction of protein synthesis from its RNA targets that function in translation, mRNA splicing and cell cycle control. Computational analyses provided evidence that the strength of protein synthesis reduction correlated with the location of LIN28B binding sites within target transcripts."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46908GSE47042	Discovery of the p53 targetome in MCF7 cells from RNA-seq data	RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on MCF-7 breast cancer cell line upon activation of p53 by the non-genotoxic small molecule Nutlin-3a	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47042GSE47058	Differential gene expression by suppression of either SOX2 or TP63 in KYSE70 human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line.	"SOX2 is a transcription factor essential for pluripotent stem cells, and development and maintenance of squamous epithelium. We previously reported SOX2 an oncogene subject to highly recurrent genomic amplification in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs)1. Here we demonstrate in SCCs that SOX2 interacts with another master squamous transcription factor p63, and through ChIP-seq show that genomic occupancy of SOX2 overlaps with that of p63 at a large number of loci and that they cooperatively regulate gene expression including ETV4, which we find essential for SOX2-amplified SCC cell survival. Furthermore, SOX2 binds to distinct genomic loci in SCCs than in embryonic stem cells and the SOX2-p63 coordinate binding is unique to SCC. In addition, a subset of SOX2 genomic binding sites in SCC that lack p63 co-occupancy are co-occupied by the AP-1 transcriptional complex. These demonstrate that SOX2s actions in SCC differ substantially from its role in pluripotency and identify novel SOX2 interactions that will enable deeper characterization of SOX2s function in SCC."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47058GSE47095	A Large-Scale RNAi-Based Mouse Tumorigenesis Screen Identifies New Lung Cancer Tumor Suppressors that Repress FGFR Signaling	We sequenced mRNA from SA cells with SFRS9 knocking down or non-silencing control.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47095GSE47114	RNA-Guided Human Gene Activation by Cas9/CRISPR-Based Engineered Transcription Factors	"Synthetic transcription factors can be applied in many areas of biotechnology, medicine, and basic research.

Recently, three different high-throughput sequencing-based methods have been developed to specifically study RNAs that are in the process of being degraded. All three methodsgenome-wide mapping of uncapped and cleaved transcripts (GMUCT), parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE), and degradome sequencingtake advantage of the fact that Illumina sequencing libraries use T4 RNA ligase 1 to ligate an adapter to the 5 end of RNAs that have a free 5-monophosphate. This condition for T4 RNA ligase 1 substrates means that mature mRNAs are not substrates of the enzyme because they have a 5-cap. As a result, these sequencing libraries are specifically made up of clones of decapped or degrading mRNAs and the 3 fragment of cleaved miRNA and siRNA targets. In this paper, we present a massively streamlined protocol for GMUCT that takes 2-3 days and can be initiated with as little as 5 g of starting total RNA and involves only one gel size-selection step. We show that the results are similar to libraries made using the previous GMUCT protocol and PARE."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47121GSE47226	Functional signature for the recognition of specific target mRNAs by human staufen1 protein	"Cellular mRNAs are permanently associated to proteins in the form of ribonucleoprotein particles. In addition to the hnRNP and SR protein families, the double-stranded RNA-binding (DRB) proteins play important roles in mRNA synthesis, modification, activity and decay (Dreyfuss et al, 2002; Stutz & Izaurralde, 2003). Staufen is a DRB protein first described as a maternal factor involved in the localised translation of specific mRNAs during early development in the fly (Riechmann & Ephrussi, 2001). One of the human homologues, human Staufen1 (hStau1) forms ribonucleoprotein complexes known as RNA granules that contain proteins involved in translation regulation as well as cytoskeleton and motor proteins to allow the movement of the granule on the microtubules. Although many cellular mRNAs have been found associated to these RNA granules, the specificity of such binding and the mechanims of hStau1-RNA interaction are still unclear. Here we identified a protected sequence signature with high homology to human Alu family of short interspersed elements at the 3-untranslated region of mRNAs specifically associated to hStau1 protein. Using a combination of affinity chromatography, RNAse-protection, deep-sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to compare the mRNAs differentially associated to hStau1 or a mutant protein unable to bind RNA we defined a collection of mRNAs specifically associated to wt hStau1. A common sequence signature consisting of two opposite-polarity Alu motifs was present in the hStau1-associated mRNAs and was shown to be sufficient for binding to hStau1 and hStau1-dependent stimulation of protein expression. Our results unravel how hStau1 identifies a wide spectrum of cellular target mRNAs to control their localisation, expression and fate. We suggest that mammalian Staufen1 protein has adapted to use the evolutionary recent Alu elements as recognition signals thereby increasing its possibilities for rapid identification to new mRNA targets."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47226GSE47399	mRNA sequencing identifies differential gene expresssion profiles between ASCC3 knock-down cells and control cells	"We sequenced mRNAs from HeLa cells transduced with either scrambled shRNA or shRNA targeting ASCC3.

Here, we show that DNA methylation is enriched in included alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) and inhibiting DNA methylation results in aberrant splicing of ASEs. The methyl-CpG binding protein MeCP2 is enriched in included ASEs, particularly those that are also highly DNA methylated, and inhibition of DNA methylation disrupts specific targeting of MeCP2 to exons. Interestingly, ablation of MeCP2 results in increased nucleosome acetylation and aberrant skipping events of ASEs. We further show that inhibition of histone deacetylases leads to a highly significant overlap of exon skipping events caused by knocking-down MeCP2. Together, our data indicate that intragenic DNA methylation operates in exon definition to modulate alternative splicing and can enhance exon recognition via recruitment of the multifunctional protein MeCP2, which thereby maintains local histone hypoacetylation through its established interaction with HDACs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47488GSE47626	Differential LINE-1 retrotransposition in induced pluripotent stem cells between humans and great apes	"Understanding cellular and molecular differences between human and non-human primates (NHPs) is essential to the basic comprehension of the evolution and diversity of our own species. Until now, preserved tissues have been the main source of most comparative studies between humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus). However, these tissue samples do not fairly represent the distinctive traits of live cell behavior, are not amenable to genetic manipulation and do not allow translation of observed differences into phenotypical divergence. We hypothesized that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could provide a unique biological resource to elucidate relevant phenotypical differences between human and the great apes and that those differences could have potential adaptation and speciation value. Here, we describe the generation and initial characterization of iPSCs from chimpanzees and bonobos as novel tools to explore our most recent evolution. Comparative gene expression analysis of human and NHP iPSCs revealed differences in regulation of Long Interspersed Nuclear Element (LINE-1 or L1) transposons. A force of change in mammalian evolution, L1 elements are retrotransposons that have remained active during primate evolution. We observed decreased levels of L1 restricting factors APOBEC3B (A3B)7 and PIWIL28 in NHP iPSCs which was correlated with increased human and chimpanzee L1 mobility and endogenous L1 mRNA levels. Moreover, results from manipulation of A3B and PIWIL2 levels in iPSCs suggested a causal inverse relationship between levels of these proteins and L1 activity. Finally, we found increased copy numbers of species-specific L1 elements in the genome of chimpanzees compared to humans, supporting the idea that increased L1 mobility in NHPs is not limited to iPSCs in culture and may have also occurred in the germline during primate evolution. We propose that differences in L1 mobility may have differentially shaped the genomes of humans and NHPs and could have had an adaptive significance."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47626GSE47718	Smoking Dysregulates the Human Airway Basal Cell Transcriptome at COPD-linked Risk Locus 19q13.2	"Rationale: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene studies have identified a number of loci linked to susceptibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a smoking-related disorder that originates in the airway epithelium. Objectives: Since airway basal cell (BC) stem/progenitor cells exhibit the earliest abnormalities associated with smoking (hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia), we hypothesized that smoker BC have a dysregulated transcriptome linked, in part, to known GWAS/candidate gene loci. Methods: Massive parallel RNA sequencing was used to compare the transcriptome of BC purified from the airway epithelium of healthy nonsmokers (n=10) and smokers (n=7). The chromosomal location of the differentially expressed genes was compared to loci identified by GWAS and candidate gene studies to confer risk for COPD. Measurements and Main Results: Smoker BC have 676 known genes differentially expressed compared to nonsmoker BC, dominated by smoking up-regulation. Strikingly, 166 (25%%) of these genes are located on chromosome 19, with 13 localized to 19q13.2 (p<10-4 compared to chance), including TGFB1, LTBP4, EGLN2 and NFKBIB, genes associated with risk for COPD.

With limited amount or degraded RNA, alternative protocols such as the NuGEN have been developed. However, it is not yet clear how the different library preparations affect the downstream analyses of the broad applications of RNA sequencing. Methods and Materials: Eight human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) lines with high quality RNA were sequenced by Illuminas mRNA-Seq PolyA selection and NuGEN ENCORE library preparation. The following analyses and comparisons were conducted: 1) the numbers of genes captured by each protocol; 2) the impact of protocols on differentially expressed gene detection between biological replicates; 3) expressed single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection; 4) non-coding RNAs, particularly lincRNA detection; and 5) intragenic gene expression. Results: Sequences from the NuGEN protocol had lower (75%%) alignment rate than the PolyA (over 90%%). The NuGEN protocol detected fewer genes (12-20%% less) with a significant portion of reads mapped to non-coding regions. A large number of genes were differentially detected between the two protocols. About 17-20%% of the differentially expressed genes between biological replicates were commonly detected between the two protocols. Significantly higher numbers of SNVs (5-6 times) were detected in the NuGEN samples, which were largely from intragenic and intergenic regions. The NuGEN captured fewer exons (25%% less) and had higher base level coverage variance. While 6.3%% of reads were mapped to intragenic regions in the PolyA samples, the percentages were much higher (20-25%%) for the NuGEN samples. The NuGEN protocol did not detect more known non-coding RNAs such as lincRNAs, but targeted small and novel lincRNAs. Conclusion: Different library preparations can have significant impacts on downstream analysis and interpretation of RNA-seq data. The NuGEN provides an alternative for limited or degraded RNA but it has limitations for some RNA-seq applications."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47933GSE47938	Multiple roles for LEC in initiation and elongation phases of snRNA gene transcription	"The small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes have been widely used as a model system for understanding transcriptional regulation due to unique aspects of their promoter structure, selectivity for either RNA Polymerase (Pol) II or III and a unique mechanism of termination that is tightly linked with the promoter.

Here we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that senses environmental stimuli, modulates pathology in psoriasis. AhR-activating ligands reduced inflammation in the lesional skin of psoriasis patients, whereas AhR antagonists upregulated inflammation. Similarly, AhR signaling via the endogenous FICZ ligand reduced the inflammatory response in the imiquimod-induced model of psoriasis and AhR deficient mice exhibited a substantial exacerbation of the disease, compared to AhR sufficient controls. Non-haematopoietic cells, in particular keratinocytes, were responsible for this hyper-inflammatory response, which involved increased reactivity to IL-1beta and upregulation of AP-1 family members of transcription factors. Thus, our data suggest a critical role for AhR in the regulation of inflammatory responses and open the possibility for novel therapeutic strategies in chronic inflammatory disorders."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47944GSE47966	Global epigenomic reconfiguration during mammalian brain development	Whole-genome single-base resolution methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine maps reveal profound changes that occur during frontal cortex development in humans and mice.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47966GSE47976	Translation-dependent displacement of UPF1 from coding sequences causes its enrichment in 3 UTRs	"The RNA helicase UPF1 is best known for its key function in mRNA nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), but has also been implicated in additional mRNA turnover mechanisms, telomere homeostasis, and DNA replication. In NMD, UPF1 recruitment to target mRNAs is thought to occur through interaction with release factors at terminating ribosomes, but evidence for translation-independent interaction of UPF1 with the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs has also been reported. To map UPF1 binding sites transcriptome-wide, we performed individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) in human cells, untreated or after inhibiting translation by puromycin. We found a strong association of UPF1 with 3 UTRs in undisturbed, translationally active cells and a significant increase in UPF1 binding to coding sequence (CDS) after translation inhibition. These results indicate that UPF1 binds RNA before translation and gets displaced from the CDS by translating ribosomes. This evidence for translation-independent UPF1-RNA interaction, which is corroborated by RNA immunoprecipitations experiments and by our observation that UPF1 also crosslinks to long non-coding RNAs, suggests that the decision to trigger NMD occurs after association of UPF1 with the mRNA, presumably through activation of RNA-bound UPF1 by aberrant translation termination."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47976GSE48159	Mapping ER genomic binding sites reveals unique genomic features and identifies EBF1 as an ER interactor [Gro-Seq]	"The C4-12/Flag.ER cell line which stably expressed Flag.ER is used to study ER genomic functions without ER interference. Mapping ER binding sites in these cells reveals ER unique distribution and motif enrichment patterns. Accompanying our mapping results, nascent RNA profiling is performed on cells at the same treatment time. The combined results allow the identification of ER target genes. Gene ontology analysis reveals that ER targets are enriched in differentiation, development and apoptosis. Concurrently, E2 treatment suppresses proliferation in these cells. Within ER binding sites, while the most prevalent binding motif is the canonical ERE, motifs of known ER interactors are also enriched in ER binding sites. Moreover, among enriched binding motifs are those of GFI, REST and EBF1, which are unique to ER binding sites in these cells. Further characterization confirms the association between EBF1 and the estrogen receptors, which favors the N-terminal region of the receptor. Furthermore, EBF1 negatively regulates ERs at the protein level. In summary, by studying ER genomic functions in our cell model, we confirm the anti-proliferative role of ER and discover the novel cross talk of ER with EBF1 which has various implications in normal physiology."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48159GSE48173	Leucegene	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48173GSE48230	Transcription factors OVOL1 and OVOL2 induce the mesenchymal to epithelial transition in human cancer	"This paper shows, for the first time, a novel function of the OVO-like proteins (OVOL1and OVOL2) as critical inducers of mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) in human cancer."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48230GSE48240	Long Noncoding RNA HNF1A-AS1 Regulates Proliferation and Migration in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Cells	"Objectives: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in the development and progression of cancer. However, functional lncRNAs and their downstream mechanisms are largely unknown in the molecular pathogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and its progression. Design: lncRNAs that are abnormally upregulated in EACs were identified by RNA-seq analysis, followed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR) validation using tissues from 31 EAC patients. Cell biological assays in combination with siRNA-mediated knockdown were performed in order to probe the functional relevance of these lncRNAs. Results: We discovered that a lncRNA, HNF1A-AS1, is markedly upregulated in human primary EACs relative to their corresponding normal esophageal tissues (mean fold change 7.2, p<0.01). We further discovered that HNF1A-AS1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage independent growth, suppressed S-phase entry, and inhibited cell migration and invasion in multiple in vitro EAC models (p<0.05). A gene ontological analysis revealed that HNF1A-AS1 knockdown preferentially affected genes that are linked to assembly of chromatin and the nucleosome, a mechanism essential to cell cycle progression. The well-known cancer-related lncRNA, H19, was the gene most markedly inhibited by HNF1A-AS1 knockdown. Consistent to this finding, there was a significant positive correlation between HNF1A-AS1 and H19 expression in primary EACs (p<0.01)."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48240GSE48263	Genome wide mapping of effects of U6atac knockdown on pre-mRNA splicing	"This project looks into experimentally identifying all minor introns by knocking down the minor spliceosome's catalytic snRNP, U6atac."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48263GSE48286	High-throughput sequencing of PROMPT-enriched samples.

H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) is deposited onto the nucleosomes in the transcribed regions following RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation. In yeast, this mark in turn recruits epigenetic regulators to reset the chromatin at an appropriate state to suppress cryptic transcription2,3. However, much less is known about the role of H3K36me3 in transcription regulation in mammals. This is further complicated by the transcription-coupled incorporation of the histone variant H3.3 in gene bodies4. Here we show that the candidate tumor suppressor ZMYND11 specifically recognizes H3K36me3 on H3.3 (H3.3K36me3) and regulates Pol II elongation. Structural studies reveal that in addition to the trimethyl-lysine binding by an aromatic cage within the PWWP domain, the H3.3-dependent recognition is mediated by the encapsulation of the H3.3-specific Ser31 residue in a composite pocket formed by the tandem bromo-PWWP domains of ZMYND11. ChIP-sequencing analysis reveal a genome-wide colocalization of ZMYND11 with H3K36me3 and H3.3 in gene bodies, and its occupancy requires the pre-deposition of H3.3K36me3. Although ZMYND11 is associated with highly expressed genes, it functions as an unconventional transcription corepressor via modulating the transition of the promoter-proximal paused Pol II to elongation. ZMYND11 is critical for the repression of a transcriptional program that is essential for tumor cell growth; higher expression of ZMYND11 is observed in triple-negative breast cancer patients with better prognosis. Consistently, overexpression of ZMYND11 suppresses cancer cell growth and tumor formation in mice. Together, this study identifies ZMYND11 as an H3.3-specific reader of H3K36me3 that links the histone variant-mediated transcription elongation control to tumor suppression."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48423GSE48552	Alteration of the microRNA network during the progression of Alzheimers disease	"We report the high-throughput profiling of microRNAs (miRNAs) from the prefrontal cortex of controls, early and late-stages Alzheimer's disease subjects.

To examine the effects of camptothecin on RNA synthesis genome-wide we used Bru-Seq and show that camptothecin treatment affected transcription initiation, elongation, termination, splicing and enhancer activity. Following removal of camptothecin, transcription spread as a wave from the 5-end of genes with no recovery of transcription apparent from RNA polymerases stalled in the body of genes. As a result, camptothecin preferentially inhibited the expression of large genes such as proto-oncogenes, and anti-apoptotic genes while smaller ribosomal protein genes, pro-apoptotic genes and p53 target genes showed relative higher expression. In addition, a set of mitotic regulator genes and histone genes were inhibited in a size-independent manner. Cockayne syndrome group B fibroblasts showed a very similar RNA synthesis recovery profile to normal fibroblasts suggesting that transcription-coupled repair is not involved in the repair of transcription-blocking TOP1 lesions. These findings of the effects of camptothecin on transcription have important implications for its anti-cancer activities and may aid in the design of improved combinatorial treatments involving Top1 poisons."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48678GSE48785	Global response to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis	"Here we use an integrated systems-level examination of transcription, translation, and proteolysis to explore how cancer cells struggle with a chemotherapeutic drug prior to succumbing to apoptosis. As a model system we study myeloma cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line clinical treatment. Despite robust transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects production of only a few critical anti-apoptotic proteins against a background of general translation inhibition. Ribosome profiling further reveals potential translational regulation of stress response genes following bortezomib treatment. Once the apoptotic machinery is engaged, degradation by caspases is largely independent of changes at the transcriptional level. Moreover, previously uncharacterized non-caspase proteolytic events also participate in cellular deconstruction. As suggested by these data, we find that inhibition of the anti-apoptotic response regulator HSF1 promotes cell death by bortezomib. Thus, monitoring global cellular dynamics after chemotherapy offers in-depth insight into apoptosis and can also guide potential therapeutic combinations."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48785GSE48812	Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the dietary chemopreventive phytochemical sulforaphane on normal and prostate cancer cells.	"Epidemiological studies provide strong evidence that consumption of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, can significantly reduce the risk of developing cancers. Sulforaphane (SFN), a phytochemical derived from cruciferous vegetables, induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses in prostate cancer cells, but not in normal prostate cells. The mechanisms responsible for these specific chemopreventive properties remain unclear. We utilized RNA sequencing to test the hypothesis that SFN modifies the expression of genes that are critical in prostate cancer progression. Normal prostate epithelial cells, and androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells were treated with 15 M SFN and the transcriptome was determined at 6 and 24 hour time points. SFN altered the expression of ~3,000 genes in each cell line and the response was highly dynamic over time. SFN influenced the expression of genes in functional groups and pathways that are critical in cancer including cell cycle, apoptosis and angiogenesis, but the specific effects of SFN differed depending on the state of cancer progression. Network analysis suggested that a transcription factor that is overexpressed in many cancers, Specificity protein 1 (Sp1), is a major mediator of SFN-induced changes in gene expression. Nuclear Sp1 protein was significantly decreased by 24 hour SFN treatment in prostate cancer cells, while a related transcription factor, Sp3 protein was only modestly decreased in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Overall, the data show that SFN significantly affects gene expression in normal and cancer cells, with key targets in chemopreventive processes, making it a promising dietary anti-cancer agent."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48812GSE48843	RNA-Seq analysis of primary AML specimens exposed to AhR modulating agents	"The goal of the study was to identify genes that are directly or indirectly coregulated by the AhR pathway in primary human AML cells.

We found that 22/26 harbored fusion oncogenes arising primarily through intrachromosomal rearrangements. Altogether 23/26 of the oncogenic drivers identified in this cohort aberrantly activate MAPK signaling, including the two novel somatic rearrangements ETV6-NTRK3 and AGK-BRAF. Two other tumors harbored distinct fusions leading to overexpression of the nuclear receptor PPAR. A lower prevalence of fusion oncogenes was found in a cohort of pediatric thyroid cancers from children from the same geographical regions that were not exposed to radiation. Radiation-induced thyroid cancers are a paradigm of tumorigenesis driven by fusion oncogenes that activate MAPK signaling or, less frequently, a PPAR-driven transcriptional program."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48850GSE48865	Whole transcriptome sequencing in 274 glioma patients reveals gene fusion profiling and novel candidate fusion genes	We detected fusion genes in 274 fresh surgical samples of gliomas using whole transcriptome sequencing.

Because the RNA intermediates in each of these steps have finite lifetimes, extensive mechanistic and dynamical information is encoded in total cellular RNA. Here we report the development of SnapShot-Seq, a set of computational methods that allow the determination of in vivo rates of pre-mRNA synthesis, splicing, intron degradation, and mRNA decay from a single RNA-Seq snapshot of total cellular RNA. SnapShot-Seq can detect in vivo changes in the rates of specific steps of splicing, and it provides genome-wide estimates of pre-mRNA synthesis rates comparable to those obtained via labeling of newly synthesized RNA. We used SnapShot-Seq to investigate the origins of the intrinsic bimodality of metazoan gene expression levels, and our results suggest that this bimodality is partly due to spillover of transcriptional activation from highly expressed genes to their poorly expressed neighbors.

We discovered transcriptomic changes and identified genomic pathways altered with initiation and progression of SCC within individual patients. We used immunofluorescent staining to confirm gene expression changes in premalignant lesions and tumor cells, including increased expression of SLC2A1, CEACAM5, and PTBP3 at the protein level and increased activation of MYC via nuclear translocation.

However, it is not yet known to what extent measurements of divergence in mRNA levels reflect divergence in protein expression levels, which are more directly tied to phenotypic differences. To address this question, we used high-resolution, quantitative mass spectrometry to collect thousands of protein expression measurements from human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We also used RNA sequencing to collect transcript expression data from the same samples. Considering the two datasets jointly we found that there is much more inter-species divergence at the mRNA level than at the protein level. Remarkably, we found dozens of genes with significant expression differences between species at the mRNA level yet little or no difference in protein expression. Overall, our data suggest a much stronger evolutionary constraint on protein expression levels than on mRNA levels. We conclude that inter-species mRNA expression differences may often have limited functional consequences due to either buffering or compensatory changes in post-transcriptional or posttranslational regulation of proteins."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49682GSE49828	The DNA methylation landscape of human early embryos	"Our data provided a genome-wide DNA methylation landscape of human early development embryos, including human MII oocytes, sperm, zygotes, 2-cell to 8-cell embryos, morula, blastocyst and postimplantation embryos at single base resolution."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49828GSE49831	Differential Protein Occupancy Profiling of the mRNA Transcriptome	"Protein-RNA interactions are fundamental to core biological processes, such as mRNA splicing, localization, degradation and translation.

Methods: mRNA profiles of Compact/unstimulated cumulus cells (CCs) from germinal vesicle (GV) COC obtained from two patients undergoing unstimulated IVM procedure and expanded/stimulated CCs from metaphase 2 (MII) COC obtained from three patients undergoing IVF/ICSI were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using Tophat software. Differential expression analysis was done using DESeq bioconductor package. qRTPCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: A total of 40-80 million sequence reads per sample were mapped to the human genome (hg19). A total of 1746 differentially expressed genes between compact and expanded CCs with fold change > 2, and adjusted p value < 0.05 were identified. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed a number of cellular processes regulated during the periovulatory interval including cellular movement, inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking, tissue development, lipid metabolism, tissue morphology, DNA replication and cell cycle. A total of 116 of the differentially expressed genes were annotated as long non-coding RNAs, 10 of them coded from introns of genes known to be involved in granulosa cell processes suggesting that unique non coding RNA transcripts may contribute to the regulation of cumulus expansion and oocyte maturation.

ChIP-seq, combined with RNA-seq, indicating that PRC2 is also associated with active genes, but most of these are not regulated by PRC2. These results were complemented by in vitro binding assays measuring the binding constant of human PRC2 to various RNAs and find comparable affinity for human lncRNAs targeted by PRC2 and irrelevant transcripts from ciliates and bacteria. PRC2 binding is size-dependent, with lower affinity for shorter RNAs. These findings support a model in which promiscuous binding of PRC2 to RNA transcripts allows it to scan for target genes that have escaped repression, leading to maintenance of the repressed state.

This was particularly true for  cell signature genes involved in transcriptional regulation. Remarkably, thousands of these genes were in a monovalent state in  cells, carrying only the activating or repressing mark. Our epigenomic findings suggested that  to  cell reprogramming could be promoted by manipulating the histone methylation signature of human pancreatic islets. Indeed, we show that treatment of cultured pancreatic islets with a histone methyltransferase inhibitor leads to colocalization of both glucagon and insulin and glucagon and insulin promoter factor 1 (PDX1) in human islets and colocalization of both glucagon and insulin in mouse islets. Thus, mammalian pancreatic islet cells display cell-typespecific epigenomic plasticity, suggesting that epigenomic manipulation could provide a path to cell reprogramming and novel cell replacement-based therapies for diabetes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50386GSE50445	IVT-seq reveals extreme bias in RNA-sequencing	"Background: RNA-seq is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying transcription and splicing events, both known and novel. However, given its recent development and the proliferation of library construction methods, understanding the bias it introduces is incomplete but critical to realizing its value. Results: We present a method, in vitro transcription sequencing (IVT-seq), for identifying and assessing the technical biases in RNA-seq library generation and sequencing at scale. We created a pool of over 1,000 in vitro transcribed RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with polyA and total RNA-seq, the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length, and we show in vitro transcription is incredibly processive, each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented. However, with common RNA-seq applications and platforms, we find 50%% of transcripts have more than two-fold and 10%% have more than 10-fold differences in within-transcript sequence coverage. We also find greater than 6%% of transcripts have regions of dramatically unpredictable sequencing coverage between samples, confounding accurate determination of their expression. We use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to show rRNA depletion is responsible for the most significant variability in coverage, and several sequence determinants also strongly influence representation. Conclusions: These results show the utility of IVT-seq for promoting better understanding of bias introduced by RNA-seq. We find rRNA depletion is responsible for substantial, unappreciated biases in coverage introduced during library preparation. These biases suggest exon-level expression analysis may be inadvisable, and we recommend caution when interpreting RNA-seq results."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50445GSE50491	Regulation of the KEAP1/NRF2 oxidative stress response pathway by BRD4 in prostate and colorectal cancer	"To identify genes regulated by BRD4 and to provide insight into new mechanisms de-regulated by BRD4, such as the response to oxidative stress, we integrated BRD4-binding regions with BRD4 gene expression data.

FMRP has been linked to the microRNA pathway and we show here that it is associated with MOV10, a putative helicase that is also associated with the microRNA pathway. We show that FMRP associates with MOV10 in an RNA-dependent manner and facilitates MOV10-association with RNAs in brain. We identified the RNA sequences recognized by MOV10 using iCLIP and found an increased number of G-quadruplexes in the CLIP sites. We provide evidence that MOV10 facilitates microRNA-mediated translation regulation and also has the novel role of increasing the expression of a subset of RNAs by sterically hindering Argonaute2 association. In summary, we have identified a new mechanism for FMRP-mediated translational regulation through its association with MOV10."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50499GSE50514	Non-IG Aberrations of FOXP1 in B-Cell Malignancies Lead to an Aberrant Expression of N-Truncated Isoforms of FOXP1	"The transcription factor FOXP1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas through immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus-related chromosomal translocations leading to dysregulated expression of FOXP1. Translocations of FOXP1 with non-IG gene sequences have been also reported, but the molecular consequences of such aberrations remain undetermined. Here, using molecular cytogenetics and molecular biology studies, we comprehensively analyzed four lymphoma cases with non-IG rearrangements of FOXP1 and compared these with cases harboring t(3;14)(p13;q32)/IGH-FOXP1 and FOXP1-expressing lymphomas without underlying t(3p13/FOXP1). We found that non-IG rearrangements are usually acquired during evolution of lymphoma and constantly target the coding region of FOXP1, promiscuously fusing with coding and non-coding gene sequences at various reciprocal breakpoints (2q36, 10q24 and 3q11). Intriguingly, these rearrangements do not generate functional chimeric genes but commonly disrupt the full-length FOXP1 transcript leading to an aberrant expression of N-truncated FOXP1 isoforms, as shown by QRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. In contrast, cases with t(3;14)(p13;q32)/IGH-FOXP1 overexpress the full-length FOXP1. Collectively, our findings point to a dual mechanism through which FOXP1 is implicated in B-cell lymphomagenesis. The primary t(3;14)(p13;q32)/IGH-FOXP1 produces the full-length protein with potent oncogenic activity, whereas the secondary non-IG 17 rearrangements of FOXP1 generate N-truncated FOXP1 isoforms, likely driving progression of disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50514GSE50535	RNA-seq melanoma	"Using a chromatin regulator-focused shRNA library, we found that suppression of sex determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10) in melanoma causes resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

The ability of RNA to base pair with itself and other nucleic acids endow RNA with the capacity to form extensive structures, which are known to influence practically every step in the gene expression program1. Yet the nature of most RNA structures or effects of sequence variation on structure are not known. Here we report the initial landscape and variation of RNA secondary structures (RSS) in a human family trio, providing a comprehensive RSS map of human coding and noncoding RNAs. We identify unique RSS signatures that demarcate open reading frames, splicing junctions, and define authentic microRNA binding sites. Comparison of native deproteinized RNA isolated from cells versus refolded purified RNA suggests that the majority of the RSS information is encoded within RNA sequence. Over one thousand transcribed single nucleotide variants (~15%% of all transcribed SNVs) alter local RNA structure; these RiboSNitches2 occur in disease-associated variants. We discover simple sequence and spacing rules that determine the ability of point mutations to impact RSS. Selective depletion of RiboSNitches versus structurally synonymous variants at precise locations suggests selection for specific RNA shapes at thousands of sites, including 3UTRs, binding sites of miRNAs and RNA binding proteins genome-wide. These results highlight the potentially broad contribution of RNA structure and its variation to gene regulation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50676GSE50760	Gene expression profiling study by RNA-seq in colorectal cancer	"The objective of this study is to identify a prognostic signature in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with diverse progression and heterogeneity of CRCs.

We found extensive signal variation in regulatory regions, which often switch between active and repressed states across individuals. Enhancer activity is particularly diverse among individuals, whereas gene expression remains relatively stable. Chromatin variability shows genetic inheritance in trios, correlates with genetic variation and population divergence, and is associated with disruptions of transcription factor binding motifs.

An example is the induction of immunity using whole parasites by exposure of malaria-naive volunteers to infectious mosquito bites while using chloroquine prophylaxis (CPS immunization). Chloroquine kills blood-stage parasites but leaves liver-stage parasites unaffected, thereby exposing the liver-stage and early blood-stage antigens to the immune system. Upon subsequent challenge, volunteers are completely protected from infection, but protective efficacy decreases when fewer infectious mosquito bites are used for CPS immunization. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of this immunity, and how it differs from naturally-acquired immunity, may provide critical insights that could aid malaria vaccine development.

We measured gene expression in a set of manually degraded RNAs, nine pairs of matched fresh-frozen, and FFPE RNA isolated from breast tumor with the hybridization based, NanoString nCounter, (226 gene panel) and with whole transcriptome RNA-Seq using RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq V2 library preparation kits. We performed correlation analyses of gene expression between samples and across platforms. We then specifically assessed whole transcriptome expression of lincRNA and discovery of eSNVs and fusion transcripts in the FFPE RNA-Seq data. For gene expression in the manually degraded samples, we observed Pearson correlation of >0.94 and >0.80 with NanoString and ScriptSeq protocols respectively. Gene expression data for matched fresh-frozen and FFPE samples yielded mean Pearson correlations of 0.874 and 0.783 for NanoString (226 genes) and ScriptSeq whole transcriptome protocols respectively. Specifically for lincRNAs, we observed superb Pearson correlation (0.988) between matched fresh-frozen and FFPE pairs. FFPE samples across NanoString and RNA-Seq platforms gave a mean Pearson correlation of 0.838. In FFPE libraries, we detected 53.4%% of high confidence SNVs and 24%% of high confidence fusion transcripts. Sensitivity of fusion transcript detection was not overcome by an increase in depth of sequencing up to 3-fold (increase from ~56 to ~159 million reads). Both NanoString and ScriptSeq RNA-Seq technologies yield reliable gene expression data for degraded and FFPE material. The high degree of correlation between NanoString and RNA-Seq platforms suggests discovery based whole transciptome studies from FFPE material will produce reliable expression data. The RiboZeroGold ScriptSeq protocol performed particularly well for lincRNA expression from FFPE libraries but detection of eSNV and fusion transcripts was less sensitive."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51124GSE51217	TALEN-based knockout of mir-141 and mir-200c in SK-BR-3 cells	"We used transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to generate knockout cells for two related microRNAs (miRNAs), mir-141 and mir-200c, which belong to the deeply conserved mir-200 family.

In doing so, we were able to systematically evaluate the sensitivity, precision, and accuracy of various approaches to single-cell RNA-seq. Our results show that it is possible to use single-cell RNA-seq to perform quantitative transcriptome measurements of individual cells, that it is possible to obtain quantitative and accurate gene expression measurements with a relatively small number of sequencing reads, and that when such measurements are performed on large numbers of cells, one can recapitulate the bulk transcriptome complexity, and the distributions of gene expression levels found by single-cell qPCR."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51254GSE51261	A histone H3.3 Lysine 36 Trimethylation Reader Connects Chromatin to Regulated Pre-mRNA Processing	"BS69 (aka ZMYND11) was initially discovered as a direct target of adenoviral E1A oncoprotein1. Subsequent studies implicated BS69 as a tumor suppressor and a transcriptional regulator2. But exactly how BS69 regulates gene expression has remained elusive. BS69 contains tandemly arranged PHD, BROMO and PWWP domains, which are known to function as chromatin recognition modalities. Here we show that BS69 selectively recognizes histone variant H3.3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3.3K36me3) via these chromatin recognition modules. Using a proteomics approach, we further identified association of BS69 with a host of RNA splicing regulators including EFTUD2 and other U5 snRNP components of the spliceosome. Remarkably, RNA-seq analysis shows that BS69 mainly regulates intron retention (IR), which is one of the least well-understood RNA alternative splicing events in mammalian cells. Specifically, loss of BS69 results in a decrease in IR, while in contrast, knockdown of EFTUD2 leads to an increase in IR, consistent with its role as a core member of the splicesome machinery. Importantly, wildtype BS69, but not a BS69 mutant defective in its interaction with EFTUD2, rescues the IR events. We also show that knockdown of SETD2, the main enzyme that mediates H3K36 trimethylation3, similarly results in a decreased retention of the same introns regulated by BS69. Significantly, a BS69 mutant unable to bind H3.3K36me3 in vitro fails to rescue the reduced IR phenotype associated with the loss of BS69. Taken together, our findings identify an antagonistic relationship between BS69 and the core splicing machinery and demonstrate that BS69-mediated RNA splicing regulation is dependent both on its ability to bind chromatin decorated by H3K36me3 and its ability to physically interact with the core spliceosome machinery. Our study reveals a novel and unexpected role of BS69 in connecting histone H3.3K36 trimethylation to regulated RNA splicing, providing significant new insights into chromatin regulation of RNA splicing."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51261GSE51264	Conserved expression of lincRNA during human and macaque prefrontal cortex development and maturation	78 tissue samples from prefrontal cortex (PFC) in human and macaque	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51264GSE51310	Chromatin stretch enhancer states drive cell-specific gene regulation and harbor human disease risk variants (RNA-seq)	"Chromatin-based functional genomic analyses and genomewide association studies (GWASs) together implicate enhancers as critical elements influencing gene expression and risk for common diseases. Here, we performed systematic chromatin and transcriptome profiling in human pancreatic islets. Integrated analysis of islet data with those generated by the ENCODE project in nine cell types identified specific and significant enrichment of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative trait GWAS variants in islet enhancers. Our integrated chromatin maps reveal that most enhancers are short (median = 0.8 kb). Each cell type also contains a substantial number of more extended (3 kb) enhancers. Interestingly, these stretch enhancers are often tissue-specific and overlap locus control regions, suggesting that they are important chromatin regulatory beacons. Indeed, we show that (i) tissue specificity of enhancers and nearby gene expression increase with enhancer length; (ii) neighborhoods containing stretch enhancers are enriched for important cell type-specific genes; and (iii) GWAS variants associated with traits relevant to a particular cell type are more enriched in stretch enhancers compared with short enhancers. Reporter constructs containing stretch enhancer sequences exhibited tissue-specific activity in cell culture experiments and in transgenic mice. These results suggest that stretch enhancers are critical chromatin elements for coordinating cell type-specific regulatory programs and that sequence variation in stretch enhancers affects risk of major common human diseases."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51310GSE51403	"RNA-seq differential expression studies: more sequence, or more replication?"	"Motivation: RNA-seq is replacing microarrays as the primary tool for gene expression studies. Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources. Results: We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the human cell line MCF-7, adding more sequencing depth after 10M reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes, while adding biological replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large scale RNA-seq DE studies.

Here we have developed a new method for a longitudinal, age-related analysis combining the merits of a pair-wise design with the statistical power of gene set enrichment analysis. We present an integrated analysis, including transcriptional changes and genome-wide epigenetic changes in DNA- methylation, H3K4- and H3K27- histone methylation in promoter regions. We tested our method on a rare collection of paired skin fibroblast samples from male middle age to old age transitions and obtained functional, age-related clusters.

However, the global properties of circRNAs are not well understood. We developed a computational pipeline to identify circRNAs and quantify their relative abundance from RNA-seq data. Applying this pipeline to a large set of non-poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project, we annotated 7,112 human circRNAs that were estimated to comprise at least 10%% of the transcripts accumulating from their loci. Most circRNAs are expressed in only a few cell types and at low abundance, but they are no more cell-typespecific than are mRNAs with similar overall expression levels. Although most circRNAs overlap protein-coding sequences, ribosome profiling provides no evidence for their translation. We also annotated 635 mouse circRNAs, and although 20%% of them are orthologous to human circRNAs, the sequence conservation of these circRNA orthologs is no higher than that of their flanking linear exons. The previously proposed miR-7 sponge, CDR1as, is one of only two circRNAs with more miRNA sites than expected by chance, with the next best miRNA-sponge candidate deriving from a primate-specific zinc-finger gene, ZNF91.

De novo mutations in methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) are a major cause of RTT. MeCP2 regulates gene expression as a transcription regulator as well as through long-range chromatin interaction. Because MeCP2 is present on the X chromosome, RTT is manifested in a X-linked dominant manner. Investigation using murine MeCP2 null models and post-mortem human brain tissues has contributed to understanding the molecular and physiological function of MeCP2. In addition, RTT models using human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from RTT patients (RTT-iPSCs) provide novel resources to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of MeCP2. Previously, we obtained clones of female RTT-iPSCs that express either wild type or mutant MECP2 due to the inactivation of one X chromosome. Reactivation of the X chromosome also allowed us to have RTT-iPSCs that express both wild type and mutant MECP2. Using these unique pluripotent stem cells, we investigated the regulation of gene expression by MeCP2 in pluripotent stem cells by transcriptome analysis. We found that MeCP2 regulates genes encoding mitochondrial membrane proteins. In addition, loss of function in MeCP2 results in de-repression of genes on the inactive X chromosome. Furthermore, we showed that each mutation in MECP2 affects a partly different set of genes. These studies suggest that fundamental cellular physiology is affected by mutations in MECP2 from very early fetal development and that a therapeutic approach targeting to unique forms of mutant MeCP2 is needed."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51607GSE51633	Brd4 and JMJD6-associated Anti-pause Enhancers in Regulation of Transcriptional Pause Release	"Distal enhancers characterized by H3K4me1 mark play critical roles in developmental and transcriptional programs.

The study will then evaluate the effect on this identified profile of ASO treatment targeting the sense strand RNA transcript of the C9orf72 gene. Methods: Expression profiling was performed on RNAs from fibroblasts of four C9orf72 patients, four control individuals and four sporadic ALS patients using Multiplex Analysis of PolyA-linked Sequences method. Results: Hierarchical clustering of expression values for all genes showed that the four C9orf72 patient lines had an expression profile distinct from control and sporadic ALS lines. Statistical comparison of expression values between the four C9orf72 lines and the four control lines revealed that 122 genes were upregulated (defined by a False Discovery Rate FDR<0.05) and 34 genes were downregulated (defined by a False Discovery Rate FDR <0.05) in C9orf72 patient fibroblasts. Conclusions: A genome wide RNA signature can be defined in fibroblasts with C9orf72 expansion.

Our data confirmed Smad7 as a functional target through which TGF--mediated EMT occurs; re-expression of Smad7 lacking its 3'UTR was able to rescue miR-181a-mediated phenotypes, deeming Smad7 as a critical mediator of miR-181a-induced EMT. Other recent studies support the crucial role(s) that miRNAs play in mediating EMT and consequent aggressive disease traits. For example, the miR-106b-25 cluster has also been shown to target Smad7 and mediate TGF--induced EMT downstream to Six1 in breast cancer34. miR-9 directly targets E-cadherin and inhibition of miR-9 had led to an inhibition of metastasis35. Conversely, the miR-200 and -205 family was shown to target transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, ZEB1 and SIP1, and re-expression of these miRNAs led to a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and prevented TGF- -induced EMT36."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52077GSE52082	Transcriptome-wide discovery of microRNA binding sites in human brain by Ago2 HITS-CLIP [Ago2-miRNA-target mRNA complexes]	"Here, seeking to gain insight into the array of transcripts engaged with miRNAs in human brain, we performed HITS-CLIP to profile transcriptome-wide Ago2:RNA interactions in a panel of eleven post-mortem adult human brain samples harvested from adult motor cortex and cingulate gyrus, regions associated with movement and psychiatric disorders ."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52082GSE52083	Transcriptome-wide discovery of microRNA binding sites in human brain by Ago2 HITS-CLIP [Ago2-miRNA complexes]	"Here, seeking to gain insight into the array of transcripts engaged with miRNAs in human brain, we performed HITS-CLIP to profile transcriptome-wide Ago2:RNA interactions in a panel of eleven post-mortem adult human brain samples harvested from adult motor cortex and cingulate gyrus, regions associated with movement and psychiatric disorders ."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52083GSE52090	Whole RNA-seq on clones of GM12878 lymphoblastoid clones DF1 and DF2	"Analysis of Allelic bias in clonal lymphoblastoid cells. Abstract: In mammals, numerous autosomal genes are subject to mitotically stable monoallelic expression (MAE), including genes that play critical roles in a variety of human diseases. Due to challenges posed by the clonal nature of MAE, very little is known about its regulation; in particular, no molecular features have been specifically linked to MAE. Here we report an approach that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with great accuracy: a chromatin signature consisting of chromatin marks associated with active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. The MAE signature is present in ~20%% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30%% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Our results open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggest that MAE is linked to cell differentiation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52090GSE52133	Identification of transcripts altered upon LIN-41 knockdown in human embryonic stem cells	"To identify transcripts altered upon LIN-41 knockdown, we transfected either a control siRNA or one of two different LIN-41 siRNAs into human embryonic stem cells and collected total RNA 72 hours after transfection."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52133GSE52148	High resolution ChIP sequencing reveals novel bindings targets and prognostic role for SOX11 in Mantle cell lymphoma (RNA-Seq)	"SOX11 (Sex determining region Y-box 11) expression is specific for MCL as compared to other Non-Hodgkins lymphomas. However, the function and direct binding targets of SOX11 in MCL are largely unknown. We used high-resolution ChIP-Seq to identify the direct target genes of SOX11 in a genome-wide, unbiased manner and elucidate its functional significance. Pathway analysis identified WNT, PKA and TGF-beta signaling pathways as significantly enriched by SOX11 target genes. qCHIP confirmed that SOX11 directly binds to individual genes in these pathways in both MCL cell lines and patients. Interrogation of an eighty-two patient gene-expression dataset demonstrated that SOX11 mRNA expression was inversely proportional to Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation. Functional studies using RNA interference demonstrate that SOX11 directly regulates WNT signaling and modulates chemotherapy sensitivity to cytarabine in MCL. We analyzed SOX11 expression in three independent well-annotated tissue microarrays from the University of Wisconsin (UW), Karolina Institute and British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA). Our findings suggest that high SOX11 expression is associated with improved survival in a subset of MCL patients, particularly those treated with intensive chemotherapy incorporating cytarabine. Transcriptional regulation of WNT and other biological pathways affects by SOX11 target genes may help explain the impact of SOX11 expression on patient outcomes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52148GSE52166	Molecular Hallmarks of Naturally Acquired Immunity to Malaria	"Immunity to malaria can be acquired through natural exposure to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), but only after years of repeated infections. Typically, this immunity is acquired by adolescence and confers protection against disease, but not Pf infection per se. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of this immunity are integral to the development of a vaccine that would mimic the induction of adult immunity in children. The current study applies transcriptomic analyses to a cohort from the rural village of Kalifabougou, Mali, where Pf transmission is intense and seasonal. Signatures that correlate with protection from malaria may yield new hypotheses regarding the biological mechanisms through which malaria immunity is induced by natural Pf infection. The resulting datasets will be of considerable value in the urgent worldwide effort to develop a malaria vaccine that could prevent more than a million deaths annually."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52166GSE52194	mRNA-sequencing of breast cancer subtypes and normal tissue	"Goal: To define the digital transcriptome of three breast cancer subtypes (TNBC, Non-TNBC, and HER2-positive) using RNA-sequencing technology. To elucidate differentially expressed known and novel transcripts, alternatively spliced genes and differential isoforms and lastly expressed variants in our dataset. Method: Dr. Suzanne Fuqua (Baylor College of Medicine) provided the human breast cancer tissue RNA samples. All of the human samples were used in accordance with the IRB procedures of Baylor College of Medicine. The breast tumour types, TNBC, Non-TNBC and HER2-positive, were classified on the basis of immunohistochemical and RT-qPCR classification. Results: Comparative transcriptomic analyses elucidated differentially expressed transcripts between the three breast cancer groups, identifying several new modulators of breast cancer. We discovered subtype specific differentially spliced genes and splice isoforms not previously recognized in human transcriptome. Further, we showed that exon skip and intron retention are predominant splice events in breast cancer. In addition, we found that differential expression of primary transcripts and promoter switching are significantly deregulated in breast cancer compared to normal breast. We also report novel expressed variants, allelic prevalence and abundance, and coexpression with other variation, and splicing signatures.

Expansions of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in the noncoding region of the C9ORF72 gene are the most common cause of the familial form of ALS (C9-ALS), as well as frontotemporal lobar degeneration and other neurological diseases. How the repeat expansion causes disease remains unclear, with both loss of function (haploinsufficiency) and gain of function (either toxic RNA or protein products) proposed. We report a cellular model of C9-ALS with motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from ALS patients carrying the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. No significant loss of C9ORF72 expression was observed, and knockdown of the transcript was not toxic to cultured human motor neurons. Transcription of the repeat was increased, leading to accumulation of GGGGCC repeatcontaining RNA foci selectively in C9-ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons. Repeat-containing RNA foci colocalized with hnRNPA1 and Pur-, suggesting that they may be able to alter RNA metabolism. C9-ALS motor neurons showed altered expression of genes involved in membrane excitability including DPP6, and demonstrated a diminished capacity to fire continuous spikes upon depolarization compared to control motor neurons. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting the C9ORF72 transcript suppressed RNA foci formation and reversed gene expression alterations in C9-ALS motor neurons. These data show that patient-derived motor neurons can be used to delineate pathogenic events in ALS."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52202GSE52249	Modelling and rescuing neurodevelopmental defect of Down syndrome using induced pluripotent stem cells from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 [RNA-seq]	"Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common viable chromosomal disorder with intellectual impairment and several other developmental abnormalities. Here, we report the generation and characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 in order to eliminate the effects of the variability of genomic background. The alterations observed by genetic analysis at the iPSC level and at first approximation in early development illustrate the developmental disease transcriptional signature of Down syndrome. Moreover, we observed an abnormal neural differentiation of Down syndrome iPSCs in vivo when formed teratoma in NOD-SCID mice, and in vitro when differentiated into neuroprogenitors and neurons. These defects were associated with changes in the architecture and density of neurons, astroglial and oligodendroglial cells together with misexpression of genes involved in neurogenesis, lineage specification and differentiation. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) on chromosome 21 likely contribute to these defects. Importantly, we found that targeting DYRK1A pharmacologically or by shRNA results in a considerable correction of these defects."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52249GSE52257	Whole transcriptome analysis of sinonasal sarcoma with translocation t(2;4)(q37.1;q31.3)	Conventioal cytogenetic on 2 sinonasal sarcoma (SNS) cases showed t(2;4)(q37.1;q31.3) translocation previously.

"Uncontrolled Th17 cell activity is associated with cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. To validate the potential relevance of mouse models of targeting the Th17 pathway in human diseases we used RNA sequencing to compare the expression of coding and non-coding transcripts during the priming of Th17 cell differentiation in both human and mouse. In addition to already known targets, several transcripts not previously linked to Th17 cell polarization were found in both species. Moreover, a considerable number of human-specific long non-coding RNAs were identified that responded to cytokines stimulating Th17 cell differentiation. We integrated our transcriptomics data with known disease-associated polymorphisms and show that conserved regulation pinpoints genes that are relevant to Th17 cell-mediated human diseases and that can be modelled in mouse. Substantial differences observed in non-coding transcriptomes between the two species as well as increased overlap between Th17 cell-specific gene expression and disease-associated polymorphisms underline the need of parallel analysis of human and mouse models. Comprehensive analysis of genes regulated during Th17 cell priming and their classification to conserved and non-conserved between human and mouse facilitates translational research, pointing out which candidate targets identified in human are worth studying by using in vivo mouse models."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52260GSE52285	A Werner syndrome stem cell model unveils heterochromatin alterations as a driver of human aging	"Our data throw light upon the effect of WRN deficiency on gene expression and epigenomic modification, which indicates aging-associated changes from both genomic and epigenomic level."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52285GSE52314	Epigenetic regulation of the MEG3-DLK1 microRNA cluster in human Type 2 diabetic islets	"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multi-factorial disease characterized by the inability of beta-cells in the endocrine pancreas to produce sufficient amounts of insulin to overcome insulin resistance in peripheral tissue. To investigate the function of miRNAs in T2DM, we sequenced the small RNAs of human islets cells from diabetic and non-diabetic organ donors and identified a cluster of miRNAs in an imprinted locus on human chromosome 14 to be dramatically down-regulated in T2DM islets. These miRNAs are highly and specifically expressed in human beta-cells. The down-regulation of this imprinted locus strongly correlates with increased methylation of its promoter in T2DM islets, providing evidence for an epigenetic modification that contributes to the pathogenesis of T2DM. Targets of the Chr 14q32 cluster of miRNAs were identified by high-throughput sequencing of cross-linked and immunoprecipitated RNA (HITS-CLIP) of Argonaute.

This presents a fundamental hurdle for modeling late-onset disorders using iPSC-derived cells. We therefore developed a strategy to induce age-like features in multiple iPSC-derived lineages and tested its impact on modeling Parkinsons disease (PD). We first describe markers that predict fibroblast donor age and observed the loss of these age-related markers following iPSC induction and re-differentiation into fibroblasts. Remarkably, age-related markers were readily induced in iPSC-derived fibroblasts or neurons following exposure to progerin including dopamine neuron-specific phenotypes such as neuromelanin accumulation. Induced aging in PD-iPSC-derived dopamine neurons revealed disease phenotypes requiring both aging and genetic susceptibility such as frank dendrite degeneration, progressive loss of tyrosine-hydroxylase expression and enlarged mitochondria or Lewy body-precursor inclusions.

To monitor the consequences of Stau1 binding in terms of target mRNA levels and ribosome occupancy, we modified the levels of endogenous Stau1 in cells by siRNA or overexpression and performed RNA-sequencing and ribosome-footprinting experiments. Staufen1 (Stau1) is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein implicated in mRNA transport, regulation of translation, mRNA decay and stress granule homeostasis. Here we combined RNA-Immunoprecipitation in Tandem (RIPiT) with RNase footprinting, formaldehyde crosslinking, sonication-mediated RNA fragmentation and deep sequencing to map Staufen1 binding sites transcriptome-wide. We find that Stau1 binds complex secondary structures containing multiple short helices, many of which are formed by inverted Alu elements in annotated 3'UTRs or in 'strongly distal' 3'UTRs extending far beyond the canonical polyadenylation signal. Stau1 also interacts with both actively translating ribosomes and with mRNA coding sequences (CDS) and 3'UTRs in proportion to their GC-content and internal secondary structure-forming propensity. On mRNAs with high CDS GC-content, higher Stau1 levels lead to greater ribosome densities, suggesting a general role for Stau1 in modulating the ability of ribosomes to elongate through secondary structures located in CDS regions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52447GSE52463	Transcriptome analysis reveals differential splicing events in IPF lung tissue	"Objectives: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex disease in which a multitude of proteins and networks are disrupted. Interrogation of genome-wide transcription through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) enables the determination of genes whose differential expression is most significant in IPF, as well as the detection of alternative splicing events which are not easily observed with traditional microarray experiments. Methods: Messenger RNA extracted from 8 IPF lung samples and 7 healthy controls was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq. Analysis of differential expression and exon usage was performed using Bioconductor packages. The gene periostin was selected for validation of alternative splicing by quantitative PCR, and pathway analysis was performed to determine enrichment for differentially expressed and spliced genes. Results: There were 873 genes differentially expressed in IPF (FDR 5%%), and 440 unique genes had significant differential splicing events (FDR 5%%). In particular, cassette exon 21 of the gene periostin was significantly more likely to be spliced out in IPF samples (adj pval = 2.06e-09), and this result was confirmed by qPCR (Wilcoxon pval = 3.11e-4). We also found that genes close to SNPs in the discovery set of a recent IPF GWAS were enriched for genes differentially expressed in our data, including genes like mucin5B and desmoplakin which have been previously associated with IPF. Conclusions: There is significant differential splicing and expression in IPF lung samples as compared with healthy controls. We found a strong signal of differential cassette exon usage in periostin, an extracellular matrix protein whose increased gene-level expression has been associated with IPF and its clinical progression, but for which differential splicing has not been studied in the context of IPF. Our results suggest that alternative splicing of periostin and other genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of IPF."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52463GSE52490	Global Bidirectional Transcription of the Epstein-Barr Virus Genome During Reactivation	"Using strand specific RNA-seq to assess the EBV transcriptome during reactivation of Akata cells, we found extensive bidirectional transcription extending across nearly the entire genome."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52490GSE52529	Pseudo-temporal ordering of individual cells reveals regulators of differentiation	"Single-cell expression profiling by RNA-Seq promises to exploit cell-to-cell variation in gene expression to reveal regulatory circuitry governing cell differentiation and other biological processes.

This reordering unmasks switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, reveals sequentially organized waves of gene regulation, and exposes regulators of cell differentiation.

Consequently, VEGF-A regulated gene expression programs have been under heavy research. In this study we study the transcriptional regulation of VEGF-A-responsive genes in primary aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using genome wide global run-on sequencing (GRO-Seq). We show that half of VEGF-A induced genes display a paused phenotype under basal conditions and are thus poised for rapid gene activation. Promoters of paused genes are distinguished from those of non-paused by higher basal enrichment for active histone marks H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac. We also show that nearly 100%% of the VEGF-upregulated genes are induced at the level of elongation, whereas 38-53%% are also induced at the level of initiation. We also report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map generated in HUVECs using tethered conformation capture (TCC) and characterize chromatin interactions in relation to transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that sites of active transcription are more likely to engage in chromatin looping and identify chromatin compartments enriched for VEGF-regulated genes.

At lineage bifurcations we show mutually-exclusive embryonic lineages are segregated through cross-repressive signals: TGF and BMP/MAPK duel to respectively specify pancreas versus liver from endoderm. Unilateral endodermal differentiation requires blockade of alternative fates at every stage, revealing a universal developmental strategy for efficient differentiation and anterior-posterior patterning of diverse hPSC lines into highly-pure endodermal populations. This culminated in hPSC-derived hepatic progenitors that, for the first time, engraft long-term in genetically-unconditioned mouse livers and secrete human albumin.

Here we describe poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) and apply it to measure tail lengths of millions of individual RNAs isolated from yeasts, cell lines, Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, mouse liver, and zebrafish and frog embryos. Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52809GSE52834	Analysis of pre-mRNA splicing trans-regulation in human lymphoblastoid cell lines	"To understand the role of trans factors in the regulation of splicing and alternative splicing, we knocked-down 22 RNA-binding proteins previously shown or suspected to be involved in the regulation of splicing (splicing factors).

In the SOD1 mouse model of ALS we found loss of the molecular and functional microglia signature associated with pronounced expression of miR-155 in SOD1 mice. We also found increased expression of miR-155 in the spinal cord of ALS subjects. Genetic ablation of miR-155 increased survival in SOD1 mice and reversed the abnormal microglial and monocyte molecular signature. In addition, dysregulated proteins in the spinal cord of SOD1 mice that we identified in human ALS spinal cords and CSF were restored in SOD1G93A/miR155-/- mice. Treatment of SOD1 mice with anti-miR-155 SOD1 mice injected systemically or into the cerebrospinal fluid prolonged survival and restored the microglial unique genetic and microRNA profiles. Our findings provide a new avenue for immune based therapy of ALS by targeting miR-155."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52946GSE52996	Contribution of natural antisense transcription to an endogenous siRNA signature in human cells	"Background: Eukaryotic cells express a complex layer of noncoding RNAs. An intriguing family of regulatory RNAs includes transcripts from the opposite strand of protein coding genes, so called natural antisense transcripts (NATs). Here, we test the hypothesis that antisense transcription triggers RNA interference and gives rise to endogenous short RNAs (endo-siRNAs). Methods/Results: We used cloned human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) followed by short RNAseq to investigate the small genic RNA transcriptome. 378 genes gave rise to short RNA reads that mapped to exons of RefSeq genes. The length profile of short RNAs showed a broad peak of 20-24 nucleotides, indicative of endo-siRNAs. Collapsed reads mapped predominantly to the first and the last exon of genes (74%%). RNAs reads were intersected with sequences occupied by RNAPolII or bound to Argonaute (AGO1 by crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids, CLASH). In the first exon, 94%% of the reads correlated with PolII occupancy with an average density of 130 (relative units); this decreased to 65%%/20 in middle exons and 54%%/12 in the last exon. CLASH reads mapping to multi-exon genes showed little distribution bias with an average of about 5 CLASH reads overlapping with 60%% of the endo-siRNA reads. However, endo-siRNAs (21-25 nt) intersecting with CLASH reads were enriched at the 5'end and decreased towards the 3'end. We then investigated the 378 genes with particular focus on features indicative for short RNA production; however, found that endo-siRNA numbers did not correlate with gene structures that favor convergent transcription. In contrast, our gene set was found notably over-represented in the NATsDB sense/antisense group as compared to non-overlapping and non-bidirectional groups. Moreover, read counts showed no correlation with the steady-state levels of the related mRNAs and the pattern of endo-siRNAs proved reproducible after an induced mutagenic insult. Conclusions: Our results suggest that antisense transcripts contribute to low levels of endo-siRNAs in fully differentiated human cells. A characteristic endo-siRNA footprint is being produced at sites of RNAPolII transcription which is also related to AGO1. This endo-siRNA signature represents an intriguing finding and its reproducibility suggests that the production of endo-siRNAs is a regulated process with potential homoeostatic impact."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52996GSE53066	Anaylsis of the effect of down-regulation of the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein in Ewing Sarcoma cells by RNA-seq.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potential markers and targets for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, respectively. We determined myocardial and circulating miRNA abundance and its changes in patients with stable and end-stage heart failure before and at different time points after mechanical unloading by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) by small-RNA-sequencing. MiRNA changes in failing heart tissues partially resembled that of fetal myocardium. Consistent with prototypical miRNAtarget-mRNA interactions, target mRNA levels were negatively correlated to changes in abundance for highly expressed miRNAs in heart failure and fetal hearts. The circulating small RNA profile was dominated by miRNAs, and fragments of tRNAs and small cytoplasmic RNAs. Heart- and muscle-specific circulating miRNAs (myomirs) increased up to 140-fold in advanced heart failure, which coincided with a similar increase in cardiac troponin I protein, the established marker for heart injury. These extracellular changes nearly completely reversed 3 months following initiation of LVAD support. In stable heart failure, circulating miRNAs showed less than 5-fold differences compared to normal, and myomir and cardiac troponin I levels were only captured near the detection limit. These findings provide the underpinning for miRNA-based therapies and emphasize the usefulness of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for heart injury performing similar to established diagnostic protein biomarkers."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53080GSE53094	Epigenetic and transcriptional aberrations in human pluripotent stem cells reflect differences in reprogramming mechanisms [RNA-Seq]	"Human pluripotent stem cells hold great potential for regenerative medicine, but available cell types have important limitations. While embryonic stem cells derived from fertilized embryos (IVF-ESCs) are considered the 'gold standard' of pluripotency, they are allogeneic to potential recipients. Autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are prone to epigenetic and transcriptional aberrations. To determine whether accumulation of such aberrations is intrinsic to somatic cell reprogramming or secondary to the reprogramming method, we generated a genetically matched collection of human IVF-ESCs, iPSCs, and ESCs derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT; NT-ESCs), and subjected them to genome-wide genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional analyses. SCNT-based reprogramming is mediated by the full complement of oocyte cytoplasmic factors, thus closely recapitulating early embryogenesis. NT-ESCs and iPSCs derived from the same somatic donor cells contained comparable numbers of de novo copy number variations (CNVs), suggesting that the two reprogramming methods may not differ significantly in mutagenic or selective pressure. On the other hand, the DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles of NT-ESCs corresponded very closely to those of IVF-ESCs, while iPSCs differed markedly from IVF-ESCs and harbored residual DNA methylation patterns typical of parental fibroblasts, suggesting incomplete reprogramming. We conclude that human somatic cells can be faithfully reprogrammed to pluripotency by SCNT and are therefore ideal candidates for cell replacement therapies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53094GSE53278	Profiling of miRNA expression of HeLa cells infected with Salmonella Typhimurium	"We identified miRNAs differentially regulated upon Salmonella infection by comparative deep-sequencing analysis of cDNA libraries prepared from the small RNA population (1029 nt) of HeLa cells infected with Salmonella (20 hpi) and mock-treated cells.

Recent advances in the field allowed researchers to identify their targets. However, much less is known regarding the regulation of miRNA themselves. The accumulation of these tiny regulators can be modulated at various levels during their biogenesis from the transcription of the primary transcript (pri-miRNA) to the stability of the mature miRNA. Here, we studied the importance of the pri-miRNA secondary structure for the regulation of mature miRNAs accumulation. To this end, we used the Kaposis sarcoma herpesvirus, which encodes a cluster of twelve pre-miRNAs. Using small RNA profiling and quantitative northern blot analysis, we measured the absolute amount of each mature miRNAs in different cellular context. We found that the difference in expression between the least and most expressed viral miRNA could be as high as 60-fold. Using high-throughput selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (hSHAPE), we then determined the secondary structure of the long primary transcript. We found that highly expressed miRNAs derived from optimally structured regions within the pri-miRNA. Finally, we confirmed the importance of the local structure by swapping stem-loops for highly and lowly expressed miRNAs, which resulted in a perturbed accumulation of the mature miRNA."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53296GSE53326	Genome-wide discovery of human splicing branchpoints [BPCapture]	"Gene splicing requires three basal genetic elements; the 3 and 5 splice sites and the branchpoint to which the 5 intron termini is ligated to form a closed lariat during the splicing reaction.

High-throughput 3Cderived methods have revealed that the genome is segmented into contiguous topologically associating domains (TADs), which help to orchestrate gene expression changes during differentiation and development2-5. Using ChIP-Seq, Hi-C and 3D modelling techniques, we reveal that TADs regulate the rapid gene expression changes induced by progestin in T47D breast cancer cells. In response to the hormone, TADs maintain their borders and operate as discrete regulatory units in which the majority of the genes are either transcriptionally activated or repressed. Additionally, the epigenetic signatures of the TADs are coordinately modified by hormone in correlation with the transcriptional changes. Hormone-induced changes in gene activity and chromatin remodelling are accompanied by structural changes that are distinct for activated or repressed TADs. Integrative 3D modelling revealed that TADs are structurally expanded if active and compacted if repressed, and that this is accompanied by differential changes in accessibility. We thus propose that TADs function as regulons to enable spatially proximal genes to be coordinately transcribed in response to hormones."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53463GSE53470	ERK signaling regulates opposing functions of JUN family transcription factors in prostate cancer cell migration	"Knockdowns of c-JUN and JUND had opposite effects on PC3 prostate cell migration.

To identify microRNAs specific to MCC (MCC-miRs), next-generation sequencing (NGS) of small RNA libraries was performed on different tissue samples including MCCs, other cutaneous tumors, and normal skin. Comparison of the profiles identified several microRNAs upregulated and downregulated in MCC. For validation, their expression was measured via qRT-PCR in a larger group of MCC and in a comparison group of non-MCC cutaneous tumors and normal skin. Eight microRNAs were upregulated in MCC: miR-502-3p, miR-9, miR-7, miR-340, miR-182, miR-190b, miR-873, and miR-183. Three microRNAs were downregulated: miR-3170, miR-125b, and miR-374c. Many of these MCC-miRs, with the miR-183/182/96a cistron in particular, have connections to tumorigenic pathways implicated in MCC pathogenesis. In situ hybridization confirmed that the highly expressed MCC-miR, miR-182, is localized within tumor cells.

In murine models, high ERG expression induces both T-ALL and AML. However, no study to date has defined the effect of high ERG expression on primary human hematopoietic cells. In the present study, human CD34+ cells were transduced with retroviral vectors to elevate ERG gene expression to levels detected in high ERG AML. RNA sequencing was performed on purified populations of transduced cells to define the effects of high ERG on gene expression in human CD34+ cells. Integration of the genome-wide expression data with other data sets revealed that high ERG drives an expression signature that shares features of normal hematopoietic stem cells, high ERG AMLs, early T-cell precursor-ALLs and leukemic stem cell signatures associated with poor clinical outcome.

Inflammatory cytokines appear to mediate the effects of MIA on neurogenesis and behavior in animal models. However, drugs and cytokines that trigger MIA can also induce a febrile reaction, which could have independent effects on neurogenesis through heat shock (HS)-regulated cellular stress pathways. However, this has not been well-studied. As a first step towards addressing the role of fever in MIA, we used a recently described model of human brain development in which induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiate into 3-dimensional neuronal aggregates that resemble a first trimester telencephalon. RNA-seq was carried out on aggregates that were heat shocked at 39oC for 24 hours, along with their control partners maintained at 37oC.

We show many non-polyadenylated RNAs were also differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection, as expected only detected by Total RNA-seq.

We tested the model by examining the global effect of miRNA on poly(A) tail of the targets. Synthetic miR-1 mimic was transfected into HeLa cells, and the poly(A) length was measured by TAIL-seq. Deadenylation of miR-1 targets was evident as early as 3 hours post-transfection without a significant change in mRNA level. After 6 or 9 hours, target mRNA level was substantially downregulated. Therefore, although there are some exceptions, our result confirms that, in general, miRNA indeed induces deadenylation.

Although the complete response rate is quite impressive, vast majority of patient presents recurrent disease. The association between CD20 expression and clinical outcome in patients strongly suggests that reduced CD20 expression leads to inferior response to RCHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone). In order to understand how loss of CD20 leads to development of RCHOP resistance, we developed rituximab resistant DOHH2 model in vivo by chronic exposure to rituximab. Characterization of several resistant in vivo xenografts revealed one model that maintained resistance to an acute dose of rituximab and demonstrated loss of CD20. Further characterization of the model demonstrated a loss of CD20 is associated with over expression of BCL2 and BIM. In vivo efficacy studies showed resistant line is insensitive to acute dose of RCHOP and treatment with an inhibitor of BCL2 (ABT199) in combination with chemotherapy resulted in better efficacy than RCHOP alone. We have identified an in vivo model of DLBCL where loss of CD20 and over expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 leads to RCHOP resistance. These data suggest the addition of BCL2 inhibitor to chemotherapy might be effective in treating CD20 negative lymphomas."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54201GSE54308	Transcriptome Sequencing from Diverse Human Populations Reveals Differentiated Regulatory Architecture	"To understand the full range of expression variation, alternative splicing, and the genetics of regulatory variation in humans, we have sequenced the genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes of 45 individuals in the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) from seven worldwide populations that span the geographic breadth of human migration history. We find few genes that are systematically differentially expressed among populations. Further, allelic expression analysis indicates that previously mapped common regulatory variants identified in eight HapMap3 populations have similar effects across HGDP populations, suggesting that the cellular effects of common variants are shared even across very diverse populations. In contrast, comparisons of alternative splicing across pairwise populations reveal highly significant differences, with ~20%% of alternatively spliced exons varying significantly by population. Greater genomic differences are associated with significantly more splicing variability overall. Together, these results provide a resource and an estimate for the degree of sharing of gene expression, alternative splicing, and regulatory genetics across populations."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54308GSE54322	"RNA-seq analysis in Cornea epithelial cells (CECs), skin epithelial cells (SECs), LSCs after knocking down PAX6 (3-D shPAX6 LSCs) and SESCs transduced with PAX6(3-D PAX6+ SESCs) upon 3-D differentiation"	"Purpose: We find that Wnt7a-PAX6 axis determine corneal epithelial cell fate. To obtain global evidence for successful cell fate conversion, we performed gene expression profiling by RNA-seq on CECs, SECs, and LSCs after knocking down PAX6 and on SESCs transduced with PAX6 upon 3-D differentiation. Methods: Under 3-D culture condition, limbal stem cell (LSCs) can be differentiated to Cornea epithelial cells (CECs), and skin epithelial stem cells (SESCs) can be differentiated to skin epithelial cells (SECs). Total RNA was isolated from CECs, SECs, and LSCs after knocking down PAX6 (3-D shPAX6 LSCs) and on SESCs transduced with PAX6 (3-D PAX6+ SESCs) upon 3-D differentiation. Libraries were prepared following published standard protocol (Fox-Walsh K et al., 2011, genomics, 266-71). mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results: Following optimized decoding and mapping workfollow, we mapped about 5 million sequence reads to the human genome and identified more than 23659 transcripts per sample. Conclusions: Hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially expressed gene signatures revealed that the gene expression pattern of SESCs with PAX6 transduction was strikingly similar to that of CECs, whereas the profile of LSCs with PAX6 knockdown was highly related to that in SECs upon differentiation. These data therefore provided global evidence for a decisive role of the WNT7A/PAX6 axis in cell fate conversion from SESCs to CECs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54322GSE54333	EDD: a program for detection of wide genomic enrichment domains robust against local variations [RNA-Seq]	"Nuclear lamins contact the genome at the nuclear periphery through large domains and are involved in chromatin organization.

We disclose a novel algorithm, Enriched Domain Detector (EDD), for analysis of broad enrichment domains from ChIP-seq data. EDD enables discovery of genomic domains interacting with broadly distributed chromatin-associated proteins such as lamins. The main advantage of EDD over existing broad peak callers is sensitivity to domain width rather than enrichment strength at a particular site, and robustness against local variations.

The expression and function of the longer transcripts namely the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the vasculature is largely unknown. Here, we characterized the expression of lncRNAs in human endothelial cells and elucidated the function of the highly expressed metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1; also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2). Endothelial cells of different origin express high levels of the conserved lncRNAs MALAT1, TUG1, MEG, linc00657 and linc00493. MALAT1 was significantly increased by hypoxia and controls a phenotypic switch in endothelial cells. Silencing of MALAT1 by siRNAs or GapmeRs induced a pro-migratory response and increased basal sprouting and migration, whereas proliferation of endothelial cells was inhibited. If angiogenesis was further stimulated by VEGF, MALAT1 siRNAs induced discontinuous sprouts indicative of defective proliferation of stalk cells. In vivo studies confirmed that genetic ablation of MALAT1 inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells and reduced neonatal retina vascularization. Gene expression profiling followed by confirmatory qRT-PCR demonstrated that silencing of MALAT1 impaired the expression of various cell cycle regulators. Silencing of MALAT1 tips the balance from a proliferative to a migratory endothelial cell phenotype in vitro and its genetic deletion reduces neonatal vascular growth in vivo."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54384GSE54392	Oct4 affects E-cadherin expression via regulating Rnd1 associated cytoskeleton rearrangement in breast cancer cells	"Oct4, a key transcription factor for maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells has been reported previously. It also plays an important role in tumor proliferation and apoptosis, but the role of Oct4 been in tumor metastasis is still not very clear. Here, we found that ectopic expression of Oct4 in breast cancer cells can inhibit their migration and invasion. Detailed examinations revealed that Oct4 up-regulates expression of E-cadherin, indicative of its inhibitory role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). RNA-sequence assay showed that Oct4 down-regulates expression of Rnd1. As an atypical Rho protein, Rnd1 can affect cytoskeleton rearrangement and regulate cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion by antagonizing the typical Rho protein, RhoA. Ectopic expression of Rnd1 in MDA-MB-231 cells changes cell morphology which influences cell adhesion and increases migration. It is reported that EMT is accompanied by cytoskeleton remodeling, we hypothesized that Rnd1 may play a role in regulating EMT. Over-expression of Rnd1 can partly rescue the inhibitory effects induced by Oct4, not only migration and invasion, but also in E-cadherin level and cellular morphology. Furthermore, silencing of Rnd1 can up-regulate the expression of E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results present evidence that ectopic expression of Oct4 increases E-cadherin and inhibits metastasis, effects which may be related to Rnd1 associated cell-cell adhesion in breast cancer cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54392GSE54401	Genomic expression analysis of human monocyte-derived DCs and monocytes	"To identify the functional non-coding RNAs in human DC development, we explored the gene expression profiles during DC development from peripheral monocytes.

Here, we have combined reprogramming and stem cell differentiation approaches with genome engineering and RNA sequencing to define the transcriptional changes that are induced in human motor neurons by mutant SOD1. Mutant SOD1 protein induced a transcriptional signature indicative of increased oxidative stress, reduced mitochondrial function, altered sub-cellular transport as well as activation of the ER stress and unfolded protein response pathways.

Two distinct types of endothelium make up the blood and lymphatic vessel system. However, it has yet to be determined whether there are distinct lymphatic-specific circulating endothelial progenitor cells. We isolated circulating endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) from whole peripheral blood. These cells are endothelial in nature, as defined by their expression of endothelial markers and their ability to undergo capillary morphogenesis in three-dimensional culture. A subset of isolated colonies express markers of lymphatic endothelium, including VEGFR-3 and Prox-1, with low levels of VEGFR-1, a blood endothelial marker, while the bulk of the isolated cells express high VEGFR-1 levels with low VEGFR-3 and Prox-1 expression. The different isolates have differential responses to VEGF-C, a lymphatic endothelial specific cytokine, strongly suggesting that there are lymphatic specific and blood specific ECFCs. Global analysis of gene expression revealed key differences in the regulation of pathways involved in cellular differentiation between blood and lymphatic-specific ECFCs. These data indicate that there are two distinguishable circulating ECFC types, blood and lymphatic, which are likely to have discrete functions during neovascularization."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54416GSE54460	RNAseq Analysis of Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Prostate Cancer Tissues	"In an effort to identify biomarkers of recurrence, we have performed global RNA-sequencing on 106 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostatectomy samples from 100 patients at three independent sites, and identified a new set of biomarkers of biochemical recurrence composed of a 24-gene panel.

Here we use digital footprinting and ChIP-sequencing to identify the core RUNX1/ETO responsive transcriptional network of t(8;21) cells. We show that the transcriptional programme underlying leukemic propagation is regulated by a dynamic equilibrium between RUNX1/ETO and RUNX1 complexes, which bind in a mutually exclusive fashion to identical genomic sites. Perturbation of this equilibrium by RUNX1/ETO knockdown results in a global reassembly of transcription factor complexes within pre-existing open chromatin and the formation of a new C/EBP-dominated transcriptional network driving myeloid differentiation. Our work demonstrates that the block in myeloid differentiation in t(8;21) is caused by the dynamic balance between RUNX1/ETO and RUNX1 activities and the repression of C/EBP and highlights the core targets of epigenetic reprogramming in t(8;21) AML."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54478GSE54505	TWIST1-induced microRNA-424 drives an intermediate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that opposes metastasis	"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process that relies on cellular plasticity; an EMT/MET axis is critical for metastatic colonization of carcinomas. Unlike epithelial programming, regulation of mesenchymal programming is not well understood in EMT. Here we describe the first microRNA that enhances exclusively mesenchymal programming. We demonstrate that microRNA-424 is up-regulated early during a TWIST1/SNAI1-induced EMT, and that it causes cells to express mesenchymal genes without affecting epithelial genes, resulting in a mixed/intermediate EMT. Further, microRNA-424 increases motility, decreases adhesion and induces a growth arrest, changes associated with a complete EMT. Patient microRNA-424 levels positively associate with TWIST1/2 and EMT-like gene signatures and is increased in primary tumors versus matched normal breast. However, microRNA-424 is down-regulated in metastases versus matched primary tumors. Correspondingly, microRNA-424 decreases tumor initiation and is post-transcriptionally down-regulated in macrometastases in mice. RNA-seq identified microRNA-424 regulates numerous genes associated with EMT and breast cancer stemness including the novel miR-424 target, TGFBR3, which regulates mesenchymal phenotypes without influencing miR-424 effects on tumor-initiating phenotypes; instead, we show that ERK signaling is critical for such tumor-initiating effects of miR-424. These findings suggest microRNA-424 plays distinct roles downstream of EMT-inducing factors, facilitating earlier stages, but repressing later stages, of metastasis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54505GSE54511	Different molecular pathways along with pathogenesis of three subtypes of Leiomyosarcoma	"Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant neoplasm of smooth muscle and is an aggressive soft tissue tumor, have complex genetic abnormalities and could be defined as three molecular subtypes.

Of the two macroH2A1 splice variants, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, the former is often suppressed in cancer and has the unique ability to interact with poly(ADP-ribose). Using ChIP-seq in primary lung fibroblasts, we demonstrate that macroH2A1 is incorporated into either of two spatially and functionally distinct types of chromatin; the first is marked by H3 K27 trimethylation, while the second contains a set of nine histone acetylations. MacroH2A1-regulated genes are involved in cancer progression are specifically found in macroH2A1-containing acetylated chromatin. Through the recruitment of PARP-1, macroH2A1.1 promotes the acetylation of H2B K12 and K120 which plays a key role in the regulation of macroH2A1 target genes in primary cells.

A dramatic change in polyadenylation site usage, leading to the systematic expression of short 3 UTR isoforms is known to occur upon induction of proliferation in resting cells. To understand the functional consequences of short 3 UTR isoform expression we used 3' end sequencing and quantitative mass spectroscopy to determine polyadenylation site use, mRNA and protein levels in murine and human naive and activated T cells. We found that while the process and its impact on the susceptibility to miRNA and RNA binding protein mediated regulation are evolutionarily conserved, the conservation is poor at the level of individual orthologous genes.

Gene expression profiling, alongside RNA immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry, revealed a wide range of new molecular networks and protein interactors related to post-transcriptional modifications for all three lncRNAs. Functional experiments in zebrafish and murine embryos, as well as differentiating human cells, confirmed a developmental-stage specific role for each lncRNA during vertebrate development.

While BT474 should be sensitive to the drug treatment, HCC1954 is expected to be resistant due to a PI3K mutation. The cell line BTR50 has been derived from BT474 and was cultured to be resistant as well. Based on RNA-Seq data, we performed differential expression analyses on these breast cancer cell lines with and without trastuzumab treatment. In detail, five separate tests were performed, namely resistant cells vs. wild type, i.e. HCC1954 and BTR50 vs. BT474, respectively, and untreated vs. drug treated cells. The significant genes of the first two tests should contribute to resistance. The significant genes of the test BT474 vs. its drug treated version should contribute to the trastuzumab effect. To exclude false positives from the combined gene set (#64), we removed ten genes that were also significant in the test BTR50 vs. its drug treated version.

Aberrant activation of the androgen receptor (AR) becomes a central mechanism contributing to the resistance of endocrine therapies2,3. Here we demonstrate that non-coding RNAs transcribed from the AR bound-enhancers RNAs (AR-eRNAs) are upregulated in human CRPC cells in vitro, xenografts in vivo and patient tissues. Expression of a subset of genes with elevated AR-eRNAs, including TLE1 and HTR3A, is inversely correlated with biochemical recurrence-free survival of CRPC patients. We identify aan HIV-1 TAR-like (TAR-L) motif in AR-eRNAs of AR target genes including KLK3 (or PSA) and TMPRSS2. The TAR-L motif is important for these eRNAs to bind to CYCLIN T1 of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex. Knockdown of PSA eRNA diminishes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) serine-2 (Ser-2) phosphorylation at the PSA promoter. The TAR-L motif in KLK3 eRNA is crucial for effective transcription of PSA mRNA.

This can be achieved by the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of a key translation initiation factor, eIF2. However, the persistent translation of certain mRNAs is required for deployment of an adequate stress response. We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a ~4.5-fold general translational repression, the protein coding ORFs of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated uORF that repress translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases.

Small RNA production depended on structure of the binding site and is globally biased towards the 5' arm of hairpins. Unexpectedly, in both species Dicer bound numerous hairpins inside mRNAs without observable small RNA production. Our data revealed ~100 mRNAs of protein coding genes to be targeted in both human and worm. These mRNAs significantly overlapped with the RNAi pathway.

Here we employed PAR-CLIP/iPAR-CLIP to identify direct Dicer binding sites in the transcriptomes of human cells and human. We found hundreds of novel miRNAs and non-canonical Dicer substrates with high sensitivity. Small RNA production depended on structure of the binding site and is globally biased towards the 5' arm of hairpins. Unexpectedly, in both species Dicer bound numerous hairpins inside mRNAs without observable small RNA production. Our data revealed ~100 mRNAs of protein coding genes to be targeted in both human and worm. These mRNAs significantly overlapped with the RNAi pathway.

We conducted the first global study of ADAR1-RNA interaction in human cells using CLIP-Seq. In contrast to the expected predominant binding of ADAR1 to Alu repeats, thousands of CLIP sites were located in non-Alu regions. This unexpectedly frequent non-Alu binding enabled discovery of transcriptome-wide functional and biophysical targets of ADAR1 in the regulation of mRNA processing including alternative 3' UTR usage and alternative splicing. In addition, a global analysis of ADAR1 binding to non-Alu regions also revealed its primary interaction with microRNA (miRNA) transcripts in the nucleus, which subsequently affected expression levels of mature miRNAs.

AECs in monolayer culture and differentiated epithelial cells in air-liquid interface (ALI) represent two distinct and commonly used in vitro models, yet differences in their response to pathogens have not been investigated. In this study, we compared the transcriptional effects of flagellin on AECs in monolayer culture versus ALI culture using exon microarrays and RNAsequencing. We found that AECs cultured in monolayer and ALI have strikingly different transcriptional states at baseline. When challenged with flagellin, monolayer AEC cultures greatly increased transcription of numerous genes mapping to wounding response, immunity and inflammatory response. In contrast, AECs in ALI culture had an unexpectedly muted response to flagellin, both in number of genes expressed and relative enrichment of inflammatory and immune pathways. In conclusion, In vitro culturing methods have a dramatic effect on the transcriptional profile of AECs at baseline and after stimulation with flagellin. These differences suggest that epithelial responses to pathogen challenges are distinctly different in culture models of intact and injured epithelium."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55458GSE55492	Gene expression profile of calcified and normal tricuspid aortic valves by RNA sequencing.	"Purpose: Calcific aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a fatal disease with currently no medical therapy. Some genes were associated with AS, but the genetic architecture of the disease has yet to be discovered. The objective of this study was to combine genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression in human valve tissues to identify new susceptibility genes of AS. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed combining the results of two independent GWAS in 474 patients that underwent aortic valve replacement from Quebec city and 486 echocardiography cases from France. The controls consisted of 3,151 publically available individuals of European ancestry. Sixty-nine SNPs selected from the meta-analysis (p < 1 x 10-4) were followed-up for replication in a third cohort of 395 cases and 404 controls. Single marker and gene set association analyses were performed. The mRNA expression levels of susceptibility genes were evaluated in 19 human aortic valves with (n=9) and without (n=10) AS by RNA sequencing. Results: Single marker analysis identified 15 SNPs with p values lower than 1 x 10-6 in the meta-analysis near the FAR2 gene on chromosome 12. At the replication stage, none of these SNPs were confirmed and three other SNPs on chromosomes 2 and 5 reached p < 0.05. Gene set analysis revealed more meaningful association with the calcium signaling pathway enriched for genes mapped to disease-associated SNPs. Genes in this pathway including F2R, GNA14, HTR4, P2RX6, and TNNC1 were found differentially expressed in valves with and without AS. Conclusions: This integrative genomic study identified new AS susceptibility genes expressed in human valve tissue. Moderate but coordinated genetic association and expression patterns were observed for genes implicated in the calcium signaling pathway and may provide new therapeutic targets to treat this frequent and rising life-threatening disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55492GSE55534	Rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II is influenced by specific gene features and histone modifications	"The rate of transcription elongation plays important roles in the timing of expression of full-length transcripts as well as for the regulation of alternative splicing. In this study we coupled Bru-Seq technology with 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1--D-ribofuranoside (DRB) to estimate the elongation rates of over 2,000 individual genes in human cells. This technique, BruDRB-Seq, revealed gene-specific differences in elongation rates with a median rate of around 1.5 kb/min. We found that genes with fast elongation rates showed higher densities of H3K79m2 and H4K20me1 marks compared to slower elongating genes. Furthermore, fast elongation rates had a positive correlation with gene length, low complexity DNA sequence and distance from nearest active transcription unit. Features that negatively correlated with elongation rate included exon density and the number of LINE sequences in the gene. The BruDRB-Seq technique offers new opportunities to interrogate mechanisms of regulation of transcription elongation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55534GSE55536	Functional and Transcriptomic Characterization of iPSC-derived Macrophages and their Application in Modeling Mendelian Disease	"Using RNA-Seq, we reported novel findings in the comparison of transcriptome profiles of isogenic HMDM and IPSDM during differentiation and polarization. First, IPSDM lost expression of pluripotency markers, had remarkably distinct gene expression profiles relative to precursor iPSCs, and had largely similar gene expression as HMDM. Second, macrophage polarization to M1 was associated with a dramatic change in the transcriptome; expression profiles of IPSDM- and HMDM-derived M1 lines were highly correlated with each other but much less so with their respective IPSDM and HMDM precursors. Third, M2-HMDM lines had limited difference in gene expression compared to their non-polarized precursors, likely due to the known M2-like phenotype of M-CSF differentiated macrophages and their similarity to the IL-4 derived M2 phenotype Finally, through RNA-Seq we identified many new genes modulated during polarization in both HMDM and IPSDM thus providing novel, and potentially regulatory, candidates that warrant further study."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55536GSE55689	Myelodysplastic syndromes are propagated by rare and distinct human cancer stem cells in vivo	Gene expression analysis of purified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells isolated from low to intermediate risk MDS patients and age-matched normal healthy controls.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55689GSE55699	Host genomic regions susceptible to damage during H. pylori infection	"We identify here host genomic regions that are more likely to be damaged during an infection with the human gastirc pathogen Helicobacter pylori and characterize underlying features of them.

We used 20 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA of the human gastric cell line AGS to produce 240 mio sequence reads in total and compared the damage-pattern of 6 h and 19 h infected cells with that of 10 Gy irradiated ones. While the overall levesl of DNA damage wetre similar in terms of broken DNA and accumulation of H2AXpS139, infection-induced damage clearly accumulates towards the ends of chromosomal arms, namely telomere-proximal and close to centromeres, it also enriches mainly in genic and especially in transcribed regions.

We report here results of an integrative genomic and transcriptomic (expression microarray and RNA-sequencing) study of six HSTL cases with i(7)(q10) and three cases with ring 7 [r(7)], a rare variant aberration. Using high resolution array CGH, we prove that HSTL is characterized by the common loss of a 34.88 Mb region at 7p22.1p14.1 (3506316-38406226 bp) and duplication/amplification of a 38.77 Mb region at 7q22.11q31.1 (86259620-124892276 bp). Our data indicate that i(7)(q10)/r(7)-associated loss of 7p22.1p14.1 is a critical event in the development of HSTL, while gain of 7q sequences drives progression of the disease and underlies its intrinsic chemoresistance. Loss of 7p22.1p14.1 does not target a postulated tumor suppressor gene but unexpectedly enhances the expression of CHN2 from the remaining 7p allele, resulting in dysregulation of a pathway involving RAC1 and NFATC2 with a cell proliferation response. Gain of 7q leads to increased expression of critical genes, including RUNDC3B, PPP1R9A and ABCB1, a known multidrug resistance gene. RNA-sequencing did not identify any additional recurrent mutations or fusion, suggesting that i(7)(q10) is the only driver event in this tumor.

Here, we use a systematic approach that integrates transcriptome-wide differential expression analysis, genome-wide p53 binding profiles, chromatin state maps, and additional genomic features to characterize the global regulatory roles of p53 in response to DNA damage in both human and mouse fibroblast models. In addition to known p53 targets, we identify many previously unappreciated mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs that are regulated by p53. Moreover, we find that p53 binding events occur predominantly within enhancer elements in both human and mouse systems. The ability to modulate enhancer activity offers an additional layer of complexity to the p53 network and greatly expands the diversity of genomic elements that are directly regulated by p53."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55727GSE55769	Dissection of estrogen receptor alpha signaling pathways in osteoblasts using RNA-sequencing	The goal is to identify estrogen-dependent gene expression patterns using RNAseq for 3 different ER forms in human osteoblasts.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55769GSE55903	'Drug-seq': An Approach to Identify the Genomic Targets of Chemicals Identified by Functional Phenotypic Screens [GRO-seq]	"Here we report an approach that has permitted us to uncover the sites and mechanisms of action of a drug, referred to as SD70, initially identified by phenotypic screening for inhibitors of ligand and genotoxic stress-induced translocations in prostate cancer cells. Based on synthesis of a derivatized form of SD70 that permits its application for a ChIP-seq-like approach, referred to as Drug-seq, we were next able to efficiently map the genome-wide binding locations of this small molecule, revealing that it largely co-localized with androgen receptor (AR) on regulatory enhancers. Based on these observations, we performed the appropriate global analyses to ascertain that SD70 inhibits the androgen-dependent AR program, and prostate cancer cell growth, acting, at least in part, by functionally inhibiting the jumonji (JMJ) domain-containing demethylase, KDM4C.

A deeper understanding of these transcriptional mechanisms may uncover novel therapeutic targets for ER-dependent cancers. Here we show for the first time that BRD4 regulates ERinduced gene expression by affecting elongation-associated phosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII P-Ser2) and histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1). Consistently, BRD4 activity is required for estrogen-induced proliferation of ER+ breast and endometrial cancer cells and uterine growth in mice. Genome-wide occupancy studies revealed an enrichment of BRD4 on transcriptional start sites as well as EREs enriched for H3K27ac and demonstrate a requirement for BRD4 for H2B monoubiquitination in the transcribed region of estrogen-responsive genes. Importantly, we further demonstrate that BRD4 occupancy correlates with active mRNA transcription and is required for the production of ER-dependent enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).

Turner syndrome is caused by complete or partial loss of the second sex chromosome; while more than 90%% of Turner cases result in spontaneous fetal loss, survivors display an array of somatic and germline clinical characteristics. Here, we derived iPSCs from Turner syndrome and control individuals and examined germ cell development as a function of X chromosome composition. We analyzed gene expression profiles of derived iPSCs and in vitro differentiated cells by single cell qRT-PCR and RNA-seq. We whoed that two X chromosomes are not necessary for reprogramming or pluripotency maintenance. Genes that escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI) between control iPSCs and those with X chromosome aneuploidies revealed minimal expression differences relative to a female hESC line. Moreover, when we induced germ cell differentiation via murine xenotransplantation of iPSC lines into the seminiferous tubules of busulfan-treated mice, we observed that undifferentiated iPSCs, independent of X chromosome composition, when placed within the correct somatic environment, are capable of forming early germ cells in vivo. Results indicate that two intact X chromosomes are not required for germ cell formation; however, clinical data suggest that two sex chromosomes are required for maintenance of human germ cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55939GSE55946	Next generation sequencing identifies discrete classes of box C/D snoRNAs featuring different ends and RNA binding protein dependency	"The paired-end next-generation sequencing of all small RNAs of less than 200 nucleotides in length from four different human cell lines (SKOV3ip1, MCF-7, BJ-Tielf, INOF) allowed us to determine the exact sequence(s) and variations of human box C/D snoRNAs (small nucleolar RNAs), revealing processing patterns of this class of molecules. Two distinct groups of box C/D snoRNAs were identified based on the position of their ends with respect to their characteristic boxes and the terminal base pairing potential. Short box C/D snoRNAs start sharply 4 or 5 nucleotides upstream of their box C and end 2 or 3 nucleotides downstream of their box D. In contrast, long box C/D snoRNAs start 5 or 6 nucleotides upstream of their box C and end 4 or 5 nucleotides downstream of their box D, increasing the likelihood of formation of a k-turn between their boxes C and D. Sequencing of SKOV3ip1 cells following the depletions of NOP58, a core box C/D snoRNA-binding protein and of RBFOX2, a splicing factor, shows that the short box C/D snoRNA forms are significantly more affected by the depletion of RBFOX2 while the long snoRNA forms, which display more canonical box C/D snoRNA features, are significantly more affected by the depletion of NOP58. Together the data suggest that box C/D snoRNAs are divided into at least two groups of RNA with distinct maturation and functional preferences."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55946GSE55949	Histone H3.3 and its proteolytically processed form drive a cellular senescence program	"In this study, we have uncovered novel proteolytic processing of the histone H3 tail in senescence models in primary fibroblasts and melanocytes.

We show that variant H3.3 is preferentially cleaved, and that cleaved histones are associated with chromatin and incorporated into nucleosomes. We also found that the histone chaperone ASF1a is required for chromatin incorporation of the cleaved histone species. Further, we show that overexpression of cleaved H3.3 induces a senescence program in fibroblasts in the absensence of oncogenic signaling."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55949GSE56010	Widespread N6-methyladenosine-dependent RNA Structural Switches Regulate RNA-Protein Interactions	"We show that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal modification in mRNA/lncRNA with still poorly characterized function, alters RNA structure to facilitate the access of RBM for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP C).

Here we find that dexamethasone (Dex, a synthetic GC) regulated genes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are associated with drug resistance. Importantly, these GC-regulated genes are aberrantly expressed in TNBC patients and associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Interestingly, in TNBC cells, Compound A (CpdA, a selective GR modulator) only regulates a small number of genes not involved in carcinogenesis and therapy resistance. Mechanistic studies using a ChIP-exo approach reveal that Dex- but not CpdA-liganded glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds to a single glucocorticoid response element (GRE), which drives the expression of pro-tumorigenic genes.

As with other carcinogenic metals, the mutagenic potential of nickel compounds is low and is not well correlated with its carcinogenic effects. Nickel exposure, however, is associated with alterations in chromatin modifications and related transcriptional programs, suggesting an alternative pathway whereby nickel exposure can lead to disease. To investigate the extent to which nickel exposure disrupts chromatin patterns, we profiled several histone modifications, including H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 as well as the insulator binding protein CTCF and the transcriptomes of control BEAS-2B cells and cells treated with nickel for 72 hours. Our results show significant alterations of the repressive histone modification H3K9me2 in nickel-exposed cells with spreading of H3K9me2 into new domains associated with gene silencing. We furthermore show that local regions of active chromatin can protect genes from nickel-induced H3K9me2 spreading. Interestingly, we show that nickel exposure selectively disrupts weaker CTCF sites, leading to spreading of H3K9me2 at these regions. These results have major implications in the understanding of how environmental carcinogens can affect chromatin dynamics and the consequences of chromatin domain disruption in disease progression."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56052GSE56055	Parallel T-cell cloning and deep sequencing of the transcripts of human MAIT cells reveal stable oligoclonal TCR repertoire	"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are abundant in humans and recognize conserved bacterial antigens derived from riboflavin precursors, presented by the non-polymorphic MHC class I-like molecule MR1.

This is mediated by two interactions: LANA binds to specific sequences (LBS1 and 2) on viral DNA, and also engages host histones, tethering the viral genome to host chromosomes in mitosis. LANA has also been suggested to affect host gene expression, but both the mechanism(s) and role of this dysregulation in KSHV biology remain unclear. Here we have examined LANA interactions with host chromatin on a genome-wide scale using ChIP-seq, and show that LANA predominantly targets human genes near their transcriptional start sites (TSSs). These host LANA-binding sites are generally found within transcriptionally active promoters and display striking overrepresentation of a consensus DNA sequence virtually identical to the LBS1 motif in KSHV DNA. Comparison of the ChIP-seq profile with whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) data reveals that few of the genes that are differentially regulated in latent infection are occupied by LANA at their promoters. This suggests that direct LANA binding to promoters is not the prime determinant of altered host transcription in KSHV-infected cells. Most surprisingly, the association of LANA to both host and viral DNA is strongly disrupted during the lytic cycle of KSHV. This disruption can be prevented by the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis, suggesting the existence of novel and potent regulatory mechanisms linked to either viral DNA replication or late gene expression."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56144GSE56148	"A novel IRES identified in DMD results in a functional N-truncated dystrophin, providing a potential route to therapy for patients with 5 mutations."	"Purpose: Ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq were used to map the location and abundance of translating ribosomes on human skeletal muscle transcripts from a patient with Becker muscular dystrophy. Methods: Tissue homogenates were prepared from frozen sections of a muscle biopsy obtained from a patient with an NM_004006:c.40_41delGA dystrophin mutation and a normal control. Ribosome-protected fragments and total RNA were prepared from a single homogenate, so starting RNA populations for both libraries were closely matched. Homogenates were not clarified before RNase digestion to avoid loss of ribosomes associated with large molecular weight complexes and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared after rRNA subtraction to avoid positional loss of 5 reads. RPF-Seq libraries were built using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and RNA-Seq libraries were built using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Kit (Illumina). RPF-Seq and RNA-Seq libraries were subjected to 50 cycles of single-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. Trimmed and filtered RPF- and RNA-Seq reads were mapped to RefSeq fasta sequences downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (hg19 assembly). Results: Most mutations that truncate the reading frame of the DMD gene result in loss of dystrophin expression and lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, amelioration of disease severity can result from alternate translation initiation beginning in DMD exon 6 that results in the expression of a highly functional N-truncated dystrophin. This novel isoform results from usage of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) within exon 5 that is glucocorticoid-inducible. IRES activity is confirmed in patient muscle by both peptide sequencing and ribosomal profiling. Conclusions: Our results provide a molecular explanation for the rescue of 5 truncating mutations via a heretofore undescribed mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of dystrophin expression. The presence of a glucocorticoid-inducible IRES within a highly conserved region of the DMD sequence strongly suggests a programmed role for alternate translation initiation, and ongoing efforts to understand the relevant cell lineage-specific and/or conditional activation signals will shed light on underlying mechanisms of IRES control and elucidate potentially novel functions of dystrophin."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56148GSE56152	RNA-seq and small RNA-seq from WT and ADAR1 knockdown H9 lines and their differentiation to specific types of neurons	Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are involved in adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing and human ADARs are implicated in neurological diseases.

We found that ADAR1 deficiency significantly retarded neural induction with widespread mRNA and miRNA expression changes. We have genome widely examined the changes of A-to-I editing and miRNA expression after ADAR1 knockdown. Such aberrant mRNA and miRNA expression was not due to reduced A-to-I editing after ADAR1 knockdown. We further revealed that ADAR1 regulates miRNA biogenesis independent of its editing activity.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56152GSE56235	Effect of PRDM11 depletion in U2932 cells	"The PR-domain family e(PRDMs) encodes transcriptional regulators, several of which are deregulated in cancer. We found that loss of Prdm11 accelerates MYC-driven lymphomagenesis in the E-Myc mouse model. Moreover, we show that patients with PRDM11-deficient diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) have poorer overall survival and belong to the non-Germinal Center B cell (GCB)-like subtype. Mechanistically, genome-wide mapping of PRDM11 binding sites coupled with transcriptome sequencing in human DLBCL cells evidenced that PRDM11 associates with transcriptional start sites of target genes and regulates important oncogenes such as FOS and JUN. Hence, we characterize PRDM11 as a novel tumor suppressor controlling the expression of key oncogenes and add new mechanistic insight into B-cell lymphomagenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56235GSE56267	The age and genomic integrity of neurons after cortical stroke in humans	"It has been unclear whether ischemic stroke induces neurogenesis or neuronal DNA-rearrangements in the human neocortex.

In cultured non-cancerous epithelial cells, KLF5 converts from pro-proliferative to anti-proliferative activity upon TGF-induced acetylation, which sequentially alters the KLF5 transcriptional complex and the expression of genes such as p15 and MYC. In nude mice, KLF5 also suppressed tumor growth in an acetylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, deacetylation switched KLF5 to tumor-promoting activity, and blocking TGF signaling attenuated the tumor suppressor activity of KLF5. The results from RNA-Seq indicated the different downstream genes of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5 and the mechanisms that determine the opposing functions of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5. These results provide novel insights into the mechanism by which KLF5 switches from anti-tumorigenic to pro-tumorigenic function, and also suggest the roles of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5, respectively, in the tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting functions of TGF."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56343GSE56361	Toxic effects of BDE209 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293)	"PBDEs are widely used in consumer and household products as flame retardants.

An accurate detection of these events is crucial for cancer research and in a long-term perspective could be applied for personalized therapy. RNA-seq technology has been established as an efficient approach to investigate transcriptomes and search for gene fusions and chimeric transcripts on a genome-wide scale. A number of computational methods for the detection of gene fusions from RNA-seq data have been developed. However, recent studies demonstrate differences between commonly used approaches in terms of specificity and sensitivity. Moreover their ability to detect gene fusions on the isoform level has not been studied carefully so far. Here we propose a novel computational approach called InFusion for fusion gene detection from deep RNA sequencing data. Validation of InFusion on simulated and on several public RNA-seq datasets demonstrated better detection accuracy compared to other tools. We also performed deep RNA sequencing of two well-established prostate cancer cell lines. Using these data we showed that InFusion is capable of discovering alternatively spliced gene fusion isoforms as well as chimeric transcripts that include non-exonic regions. In addition our method can detect anti-sense transcription in the fusions by incorporating strand specificity of the sequencing library."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56512GSE56568			GSE56623	"RNAseq to investigate transcriptional changes in human MM cell lines due to panobinostat, 5-Azacytidine, panobinostat+5-Azacytidine or n-methyl-2-pyrroldine (NMP) treatments."	"Purpose: We applied RNA sequencing technology for high-throughput analysis of transcriptional changes within human MM cell lines JJN3 and U266 due to individual and combination drug treatment. Methods: JJN3 and U266 cells were treated with pan-HDACi panbobinostat, DNMTi 5-Azacytidine, panobinostat+5-Azacytidine or NMP for 4h or 24h in triplicate and transcriptional changes assessed by RNAseq using Illumina HiSeq platform. Specifically, JJN3 cells were treated with 10nM panobinostat, 2.5M 5-Azacytidine, panobinostat+5-Azacytidine (at given doses), or 10mM NMP. U266 cells were treated with 10nM panobinostat, 10M 5-Azacytidine, panobinostat+5-Azacytidine (at given doses), or 10mM NMP. Results: We report unique and overlapping transcriptional signatures that lead to the induction of apoptosis in human MM cell lines in a cell-specific manner due to individual or combination treatments.

Although the cytoplasmic function of Dicer is well documented in mammals, there is little known about any possible nuclear function. Here we show that Dicer is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but that its nuclear levels are tightly regulated. In its nuclear manifestation Dicer interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at actively-transcribed gene loci. Loss of Dicer causes the appearance of endogenous dsRNA, leading to induction of the interferon response pathway and consequent cell death. Our results suggest that Pol II-associated Dicer restricts endogenous dsRNA formation from overlapping non-coding RNA transcription units. Failure to do so has catastrophic effects on cell function. Taken together, we present here a micro (mi)RNA independent role for human nuclear Dicer."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56648GSE56660	Establishment of Highly Tumorigenic Human Colorectal Cancer Cell Line (CR4) with Properties of Putative Cancer Stem Cells	"Colorectal cancer (CRC) has the third highest incidence and mortality rates among the US population.

Androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7) is a truncated form of the androgen receptor protein which lacks the ligand-binding domain, the target of enzalutamide and abiraterone, but remains constitutively active as a transcription factor. We hypothesized that detection of AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from men with advanced prostate cancer would be associated with resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. Methods. We used quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) to interrogate CTCs for the presence or absence of AR-V7 from prospectively enrolled patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer initiating treatment with either enzalutamide or abiraterone. We examined associations between AR-V7 status and PSA response rates, PSA-progression-free-survival (PSA-PFS), clinical/radiographic-progression-free-survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the independent effect of AR-V7 status on clinical outcomes. Results. Thirty-one enzalutamide-treated patients and thirty-one abiraterone-treated patients were enrolled, of which 38.7%% and 19.4%% had detectable AR-V7 from CTCs, respectively. Among men receiving enzalutamide, AR-V7positive patients had inferior PSA response rates (0%% vs 52.6%%, P=0.004), PSA-PFS (median: 1.4 vs 6.0 months, P<0.001), PFS (median: 2.1 vs 6.1 months, P<0.001), and OS (median: 5.5 months vs not reached, P=0.002) compared to AR-V7negative patients. Similarly, among men receiving abiraterone, AR-V7positive patients had inferior PSA response rates (0%% vs 68.0%%, P=0.004), PSA-PFS (median: 1.3 months vs not reached, P<0.001), PFS (median: 2.3 months vs not reached, P<0.001), and OS (median: 10.6 months vs not reached, P=0.006).

Here, we demonstrate that MOV10 has an ATP-dependent 5' to 3' in vitro RNA unwinding activity and determine the RNA-binding sites of MOV10 and its helicase mutants using PAR-CLIP. We find that MOV10 predominantly binds to 3' UTRs upstream of regions predicted to form local secondary structures and provide evidence that MOV10 helicase mutants are impaired in their ability to translocate 5' to 3' on their mRNA targets. MOV10 interacts with UPF1, the key component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. PAR-CLIP of UPF1 reveals that MOV10 and UPF1 bind to RNA in close proximity. Knockdown of MOV10 resulted in increased mRNA half-lives of MOV10-bound as well as UPF1-regulated transcripts, suggesting that MOV10 functions in UPF1-mediated mRNA degradation as an RNA clearance factor to resolve structures and displace proteins from 3' UTRs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56748GSE56785	RNA-Seq characterization of human H1-derived NPC differentiation timecourse	High resolution transcriptional profiling of H1-derived human neuronal precursor cells over a timecourse of differentiation in vitro.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56785GSE56787	DUX4-induced gene expression is the major molecular signature in FSHD skeletal muscle	"Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array and recent studies have shown that this results in the expression of low levels of the DUX4 mRNA in skeletal muscle. Several other mechanisms have been suggested for FSHD pathophysiology and it remains unknown whether DUX4 expression can account for most of the molecular changes seen in FSHD. Since DUX4 is a transcription factor, we used RNA-seq to measure gene expression in muscle cells transduced with DUX4, and in muscle cells and biopsies from control and FSHD individuals. We show that DUX4 target gene expression is the major molecular signature in FSHD muscle together with a gene expression signature consistent with an immune cell infiltration. In addition, one unaffected individual without a known FSHD-causing mutation showed expression of DUX4 target genes. This individual has a sibling with FSHD and also without a known FSHD-causing mutation, suggesting the presence of yet unidentified modifier locus for DUX4 expression and FSHD.

To date, knowledge of gene expression changes accompanying corticogenesis is largely based on murine data. Here we present a searchable, comprehensive, temporal gene expression dataset encompassing cerebral cortical development from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Using a modified differentiation protocol and RNA-Seq technology with computational analysis, we identified sets of genes and long non-coding RNAs that significantly change during corticogenesis, and those enriched for disease-associations. Numerous alternatively-spliced genes with varying temporal patterns of expression are revealed, including TGIF1, involved in holoprosencephaly and MARK1, involved in autism.

However, their implication in small RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing in the mammalian cell nucleus is less understood. We have recently shown that intronic siRNAs cause chromatin modifications that inhibit RNA polymerase II elongation and modulate alternative splicing in an Argonaute-1 (AGO1) dependent manner. Here we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to investigate the genome-wide distribution of AGO1 nuclear targets. Unexpectedly we found that about 80%% of AGO1 clusters are associated with cell-type specific transcriptional enhancers, most of them (73%%) overlapping active enhancers. This association seems to be mediated by long, rather than short, enhancer RNAs; and to be more prominent in intragenic, rather than intergenic, enhancers. Paradoxically, crossing ChIP-seq with RNA-seq data upon AGO1 depletion revealed that enhancer bound AGO1 is not linked to the global regulation of gene transcription but to the control of constitutive and alternative splicing, which was confirmed by an individual gene analysis explaining how AGO1 controls inclusion levels of the cassette exon 107 in the SYNE2 gene."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56826GSE56862	Genome-wide quantification of microRNA processing efficiency from RNA-seq data	"Microprocessor is responsible for conversion of pri-miRNA transcripts into pre-miRNA hairpins in miRNA biogenesis. The in vivo properties of this process remain enigmatic. Here, we present the first study of in vivo transcriptome-wide pri-miRNA processing using next-generation sequencing of chromatin-associated pri-miRNAs. We identify a distinctive Microprocessor signature in the transcriptome profile, from which efficiency of the endogenous processing event can be accurately quantified. This analysis reveals differential susceptibility to Microprocessor cleavage as a key regulatory step in miRNA biogenesis. Processing is highly variable among pri-miRNAs and a better predictor of miRNA abundance than primary transcription itself. Processing is also largely stable across three cell lines, suggesting a major contribution of sequence determinants. Based on differential processing efficiencies we define functionality for short sequence features adjacent to the pre-miRNA hairpin. In conclusion, we identify Microprocessor as the main hub for diversified miRNA output and suggest a role for uncoupling miRNA biogenesis from host gene expression."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56862GSE56887	RNA G-quadruplexes cause eIF4A-dependent oncogene translation in cancer	"The translational control of oncoprotein expression is implicated in many cancers. Here we report an eIF4A/DDX2 RNA helicase-dependent mechanism of translational control that contributes to oncogenesis and underlies the anticancer effects of Silvestrol and related compounds. For example, eIF4A promotes T-ALL development in vivo and is required for leukaemia maintenance. Accordingly, inhibition of eIF4A with Silvestrol has powerful therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo. We use transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting to identify the hallmarks of eIF4A-dependent transcripts. These include 5'UTR sequences such as the 12-mer guanine quartet (CGG)4 motif that can form RNA G-quadruplex structures. Notably, among the most eIF4A-dependent and Silvestrol-sensitive transcripts are a number of oncogenes, super-enhancer associated transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators. Hence, the 5'UTRs of selected cancer genes harbour a targetable requirement for the eIF4A RNA helicase."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56887GSE56900	RUNX3 Facilitates Growth of Ewing Sarcoma Cells	"Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric small round cell tumor that predominantly occurs in bone. Approximately 85%% of Ewing sarcomas harbor the EWS/FLI fusion protein, which arises from a chromosomal translocation, t(11:22)(q24:q12). EWS/FLI interacts with numerous lineage-essential transcription factors to maintain mesenchymal progenitors in an undifferentiated state. We previously showed that EWS/FLI binds the osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2 and prevents osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we investigated the role of another Runt-domain protein, RUNX3, in Ewing sarcoma. RUNX3 participates in mesenchymal-derived bone formation and is a context dependent tumor suppressor and oncogene. RUNX3 was detected in all Ewing sarcoma cells examined, whereas RUNX2 was detected in only 73%% of specimens. Like RUNX2, RUNX3 binds to EWS/FLI via its Runt domain. EWS/FLI prevented RUNX3 from activating the transcription of a RUNX-responsive reporter, p6OSE2. Stable suppression of RUNX3 expression in the Ewing sarcoma cell line A673 delayed colony growth in anchorage independent soft agar assays and reversed expression of EWS/FLI-responsive genes. These results demonstrate an important role for RUNX3 in Ewing sarcoma."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56900GSE56924	Ribosome profiling reveals an important role for translational control in circadian gene expression	"Physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms are driven by a conserved transcriptional/translational negative feedback loop in mammals. Although most core clock factors are transcription factors, post-transcriptional control introduces delays that are critical for circadian oscillations. Little work has been done on circadian regulation of translation, so to address this deficit we conducted ribosome profiling experiments in a human cell model for an autonomous clock. We found that most rhythmic gene expression occurs with little delay between transcription and translation, suggesting that the lag in the accumulation of some clock proteins relative to their mRNAs does not arise from regulated translation. Nevertheless, we found that translation occurs in a circadian fashion for many genes, sometimes imposing an additional level of control on rhythmically expressed mRNAs and, in other cases, conferring rhythms on non-cycling mRNAs. Most cyclically transcribed RNAs are translated at one of two major times in a 24h day, while rhythmic translation of most non-cyclic RNAs is phased to a single time of day. Unexpectedly, we found that the clock also regulates the formation of cytoplasmic processing (P) bodies, which control the fate of mRNAs, suggesting circadian coordination of mRNA metabolism and translation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56924GSE56930	Human intestinal tissue with adult stem cell properties derived from pluripotent stem cells	"Genetically engineered human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been proposed as a source for transplantation therapies and are rapidly becoming valuable tools for human disease modeling. However, many of the potential applications are still limited by the lack of robust differentiation paradigms that allow for the isolation of defined functional tissues. These challenges could be overcome by the use of adult tissue stem cells derived from hPSCs, as their restricted potential could limit the differentiation towards other undesired linages, and allow in vitro expansion and long- term propagation of fully differentiated tissue. To isolate adult stem cells from hPSCs, we applied genome-editing to generate an LGR5-GFP reporter system and subsequently developed a differentiation protocol for human intestinal tissue comprising an adult stem cell niche and all major cell types of the adult intestine. This novel derivation protocol is highly robust and even permits the isolation of intestinal organoids without the LGR5 reporter. Transcriptional profiling, electron microscopy and functional analysis revealed that such human organoid cultures could be derived with high purity, and a composition and morphology similar to that of cultures obtained from human biopsies. Importantly, hPSC-derived organoids responded to the canonical signaling pathways that control self-renewal and differentiation in the adult human intestinal stem cell compartment. With our ability to genetically engineer hPSCs using site-specific nucleases, this adult stem cell system provides a novel platform by which to study human intestinal disease in vitro."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56930GSE56961	Transcriptome sequencing of a large human family identifies the impact of rare non-coding variants	"We have combined high-quality genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing data within a 17-individual, three generation family. Using these data, we have contrasted cis-acting expression, allele-specific expression and splicing quantitative trait loci (collectively termed eQTLs) within the family to eQTLs discovered within a cell-type and ethnicity-matched population sample. We identified that eQTL that exhibit larger effects in the family compared to the population are enriched for rare regulatory and splicing variants and were more likely to influence essential genes. In addition, we identify several large effect-size eQTLs within the family for genes involved in complex disease. Through analysis of eQTLs in a large family we also report the utility of non-coding genome annotation to predicting the effect of rare non-coding variants. We find that a combination of distance to the transcription start site, evolutionary constraint and epigenetic annotation is considerably more informative for predicting the consequence of rare non-coding variants than for common variants. In summary, through transcriptome analyses within a large family we are able to identify the contribution of rare non-coding variants to expression phenotypes and further demonstrate the predictive potential of diverse non-coding genome annotation for interpretation of the impact of rare non-coding variants."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56961GSE57027	Controlling for gene expression changes in transcription factor protein networks.	"The development of affinity purification technologies together with mass spectrometric analyses of the purified protein mixtures (AP-MS) has been used both to identify new protein-protein interactions and to define the subunit composition of protein complexes. Transcription factor protein interactions, however, have not been systematically analyzed using these approaches. Here, we have investigated whether ectopic expression of an affinity tagged transcription factor as bait in AP-MS experiments perturbs gene expression in cells resulting in false positive identification of bait associated proteins when typical experimental controls are used. Using quantitative proteomics and RNA-Seq, we determined that the increase in the abundance of a set of proteins caused by overexpression of the transcription factor RelA is not sufficient for these proteins to then copurify non-specifically and be misidentified as bait associated proteins. Therefore typical controls should be sufficient and a number of different baits can be compared with a common set of controls. This is of practical interest when identifying bait interactors from a large number of different baits. As expected, we found several known RelA interactors enriched in our RelA purifications (NFB1, NFB2, Rel, RelB, IB, IB and IB). We also found several proteins not previously described in association with RelA, including the small mitochondrial chaperone Tim13. Using a variety of biochemical approaches, we further investigated the nature of the association between Tim13 and NFB family transcription factors. The work here therefore provides a conceptual and experimental framework for analyzing transcription faction protein interactions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57027GSE57049	Localization and Abundance Analysis of Human lncRNAs at Single Cell and Single Molecule Resolution	"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key players in different cellular processes and are required for diverse functions in vivo. However, fundamental aspects of lncRNA biology remain poorly characterized, including their subcellular localization, abundance and variation at a single cell resolution. Here, we used single molecule, single-cell RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) to survey 61 lncRNAs, chosen by properties such as conservation, tissue specific expression, and expression abundance, and to catalog their abundance and cellular localization patterns in three human cell types. Our lncRNAs displayed diverse sub-cellular localization patterns ranging from strictly nuclear localization to almost exclusive cytoplasmic localization, with the majority localized primarily in the nucleus. The low abundance of these lncRNAs as measured in bulk cell populations cannot be explained by high expression in a small subset of 'jackpot' cells. Simultaneous analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAs from corresponding divergently transcribed loci showed that divergent lncRNAs do not present a distinct localization pattern and are not always co-regulated with their neighbor. Overall, our study highlights important differences and similarities between lncRNAs and mRNAs. The rich set of localization patterns we observe are consistent with a broad range of potential functions for lncRNA, and assists in hypothesis generation for mechanistic studies.

We used an antibody directed against SUSD2 (W5C5) to isolate perivascular (W5C5+) and non-perivascular (W5C5-) fibroblasts from mid-luteal biopsies. We show that SUSD2 expression, and hence the ratio of W5C5+ to W5C5- cells, changes in culture depending on cell-cell contact and activation of the Notch signaling pathway. RNA sequencing revealed that cultures derived from W5C5+ progenitor cells remain phenotypically distinct by the enrichment of novel and established endometrial perivascular signature genes. In an undifferentiated state, W5C5+-derived cells produced lower levels of various chemokines and inflammatory modulators when compared to their W5C5- counterparts. This divergence in secretomes became more pronounced upon decidualization, which transformed perivascular W5C5+ cells into the dominant source of a range of trophic and immunomodulatory cytokines, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Our findings indicate that the decidual response is spatially organized with differentiating perivascular cells establishing distinct cytokine and chemokine gradients that could direct trophoblast towards maternal vessels and govern local immune responses in pregnancy."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57182GSE57222	NSD3-NUT Fusion Oncoprotein in NUT Midline Carcinoma identified in 1221 patient-derived cell line by RNA-seq	"Discarded live tumor tissue from a metastatic focus in the patients lung was collected under institutional review board approval through the NUT midline carcinoma registry (www.NMCRegistry.org). From this tissue the first known NUT-variant cell line, 1221, was established. To determine the putative partner gene to NUT, we performed comprehensive RNA-sequencing on RNA purified from 1221. We identified an in-frame transcript fusing the 5 coding sequence of NSD3 (exons 1-7) to exons 2-7 of NUT.

Here we uncovered a splicing-mediated pathway that is essential for breast cancer metastasis. We show that the RNA-binding protein hnRNPM promotes breast cancer metastasis by activating the switch of alternative splicing that occurs during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Genome-wide deep sequencing analysis suggests that hnRNPM potentiates TGFb signaling and identifies CD44 as a key downstream target of hnRNPM. hnRNPM ablation prevents TGFb-induced EMT and inhibits breast cancer metastasis in mice, whereas enforced expression of the specific CD44s splice isoform overrides the loss of hnRNPM and permits EMT and metastasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the ubiquitously expressed hnRNPM acts in a mesenchymal-specific manner to precisely control CD44 splice isoform switching during EMT. This restricted cell-type activity of hnRNPM is achieved by competition with ESRP1, an epithelial-splicing regulator that binds to the same cis-regulatory RNA elements and is repressed during EMT. Importantly, hnRNPM is associated with aggressive breast cancer and correlates with increased CD44s in patient specimens. These findings demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism through which tumor metastasis is endowed by the hnRNPM-mediated splicing program."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57243GSE57253	An activating NLRC4 inflammasome mutation causes autoinflammation with recurrent macrophage activation syndrome	"Inflammasomes are intracellular innate immune sensors that respond to pathogen and damage-associated signals with the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1, resulting in IL-1_ and IL-18 secretion and macrophage pyroptosis. The discovery that heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in NLRP3 lead to oversecretion of IL-1_ and cause the autoinflammatory disease spectrum Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS), led to the successful use of IL-1 blocking therapies1. We found that a de novo missense mutation in the regulatory domain of the NLRC4 (IPAF, CARD12) inflammasome causes early-onset recurrent fever flares and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Functional analyses demonstrated spontaneous production of the inflammasome-dependent cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 exceeding levels in CAPS patients. The NLRC4 mutation led to constitutive caspase-1 cleavage in transduced cells and enhanced spontaneous production of IL-18 by both patient and NLRC4 mutant macrophages. Thus, we describe a novel monoallelic inflammasome defect that expands the autoinflammatory paradigm to include MAS and suggests novel targets for therapy."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57253GSE57254	Silencing RNA-binding protein CELF1 inhibits tumor growth and alters gene expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma	"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of gene expression, but only a small fraction have been studied for their role in malignancy. Here we report a systematic analysis of RBP CUGBP Elav-Like Family member 1 (CELF1 alias CUGBP1) roles in mRNA alternative splicing, translation and turnover in oral cancer cells. CELF1 is overexpressed in carcinogen-induced oral cancer tumorigenesis mouse model and specific inhibition of CELF1 reduces tumor growth in vivo. Deep transcriptomic analysis revealed that hundreds of mRNAs were differentially regulated as a function of CELF1 expression in oral cancer cells. More importantly, the presence of CELF1 promoted alternative splicing of several target mRNAs which are known to be involved in various cancer biological processes. Using a pulse SILAC-based quantitative proteomic approach, we observed hundreds of proteins whose translation was controlled by CELF1 and those altered proteins were implicated in malignancy. Altogether, these data provided a comprehensive view of the CELF1 mRNA regulatory network in OSCC and suggests that CELF1 is a viable target for therapeutic intervention. Significance Post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate cancer cells which are believed to constitute the driving force of many malignancies are poorly understood. We show that oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) emerge as a result of an over expressed RNA-binding protein CELF1, a protein implicated in mRNA turnover, alternative splicing and translation. The resulting mRNA expression repertoire regulates networks of genes whose expression changes regulate oral cancer pathogenesis. Inhibition of CELF1 mitigated OSCC tumor-forming capacity and offers an attractive therapeutic option for oral malignancies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57254GSE57278	A global regulatory mechanism for activating an exon network required for neurogenesis	"The vertebrate and neural-specific SR-related protein nSR100/SRRM4 regulates an extensive program of alternative splicing with critical roles in nervous system development. However, the mechanism by which nSR100 controls its target exons is poorly understood. We demonstrate that nSR100-dependent neural exons are associated with a unique configuration of intronic cis-elements that promote rapid switch-like regulation during neurogenesis. A key feature of this configuration is the insertion of specialized intronic enhancers between polypyrimidine tracts and acceptor sites that bind nSR100 to potently activate exon inclusion in neural cells, while weakening 3' splice site recognition and contributing to exon skipping in non-neural cells. nSR100 further operates by forming multiple interactions with early spliceosome components bound proximal to 3' splice sites. These multifaceted interactions achieve dominance over neural exon silencing mediated by the splicing regulator PTBP1. The results thus illuminate a widespread mechanism by which a critical neural exon network is activated during neurogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57278GSE57299	"Transcriptome data of CD34+ human cord blood-derived cell treated with UM171, SR1 or both"	"mRNA profiling of CD34+ human cord blood-derived cell treated with UM171, SR1 or both"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57299GSE57325	BCLAF1 and its pre-mRNA splicing regulator SRSF10 both regulate tumorigenic capacity of human colon cancer cells	"Bcl-2-accociated transcription factor 1(BCLAF1) has been shown to be involved in multiple biological processes. Transcript variants encoding different isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing have been found for this gene, but little is known about the mechanisms governing its splicing regulation and whether the misregulation is associated with cancer development. Mechanistic analysis revealed that splicing factor SRSF10 specifically interacts with exon5a and activates its inclusion, as RNAi-mediated knockdown of SRSF10 induced a dramatic skipping of exon5a. To define a comprehensive programm of alternative splicing that is regulated by SRSF10 in RKO cells, we used RNA-seq coupled with a bioinformatic analysis to identify the extensive splicing network regulated by SRSF10 in RKO cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57325GSE57353	Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation in Aicardi-Goutires syndrome	"Aicardi-Goutires syndrome (AGS) is a severe childhood inflammatory disorder that shows clinical and genetic overlap with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). AGS is thought to arise from the accumulation of incompletely metabolized endogenous nucleic acid species owing to mutations in nucleic acid degrading enzymes TREX1 (AGS1), RNase H2 (AGS2, 3 and 4) and SAMHD1 (AGS5). However, the identity and source of such immunogenic nucleic acid species remain undefined. Using genome-wide approaches, we show that fibroblasts from AGS patients with AGS1-5 mutations are burdened by excessive loads of RNA:DNA hybrids. Using MethylC-seq, we show that AGS fibroblasts display pronounced and global loss of DNA methylation and demonstrate that AGS-specific RNA:DNA hybrids often occur within DNA hypomethylated regions. Altogether, our data suggest that RNA:DNA hybrids may represent a common immunogenic form of nucleic acids in AGS and provide the first evidence of epigenetic perturbations in AGS, furthering the links between AGS and SLE."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57353GSE57369	The chromatin modifier CHD8 targets autism risk genes during human neurodevelopment	"Whole-exome sequencing studies have implicated chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the identification of de novo loss of function mutations in affected individuals. Many of these genes are co-expressed in mid-fetal human cortex, suggesting ASD risk genes converge in regulatory networks that are perturbed in ASD during neurodevelopment. To elucidate such networks we mapped promoters and enhancers bound by the chromodomain helicase CHD8, which is strongly enriched in ASD-associated de novo loss of function mutations, using ChIP-seq in mid-fetal human brain, human neural stem cells (hNSCs), and embryonic mouse cortex. We find that CHD8 targets are strongly enriched for ASD risk genes that converge in ASD-associated co-expression networks in human midfetal cortex. CHD8 knockdown in hNSCs results in significant dysregulation of ASD risk genes targeted by CHD8, as well as additional genes important for neurodevelopment, including members of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. Integration of CHD8 binding data with genetic and gene co-expression data in ASD risk models provides support for additional ASD risk genes. Together, our results suggest that loss of CHD8 function contributes to ASD through regulatory perturbation of other ASD risk genes during human cortical development."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57369GSE57395	Direct Induction of Hematoendothelial Program in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells by Transcriptional Regulators	"Advancing pluripotent stem cell technologies for modeling hematopoietic stem cell development and therapies requires identifying key regulators of hematopoietic commitment from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Here, by screening the effect of 27 candidate factors, we identified two groups of transcriptional regulators capable of inducing distinct hematopoietic programs from hPSCs: pan-myeloid (GATA2 and ETV2) and erythro-megakaryocytic (GATA2 and TAL1). In both cases, these transcription factors directly converted hPSCs to endothelium, which subsequently transformed into blood cells with pan-myeloid or eryhtro-megakaryocytic potential. These data demonstrate that two distinct genetic programs regulate the hematopoietic development from hPSCs and that both of these programs specify hPSCs directly to hemogenic endothelial cells. Additionally, this study provides a novel method for efficient induction of blood and endothelial cells from hPSCs via overexpression of modified mRNA for selected transcription factors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57395GSE57397	Transriptional profiling upon heat shock and recovery in cells deficient for FBXW7 and their wild type counterpart.

Here, we provide evidence that a transcriptional regulator, HEXIM1, is upregulated in response to leflunomide. HEXIM1 is assembled into the 7SK snRNP complex to sequester and inhibit the kinase P-TEFb. P-TEFb triggers elongation by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II and pausing factors. Knockdown of hexim in zebrafish rescues the effects of leflunomide. HEXIM1 expression is low in human melanoma. In addition, HEXIM1 overexpression can suppress melanoma onset in zebrafish. Increased HEXIM1 expression, in response to low nucleotides triggered by DHODH inhibition, sequesters P-TEFb away from melanoma pathogenesis, proliferation and cell cycle genes based on GRO-seq and ChIP-seq analyses. This reduces productive elongation at genes that maintain the tumorigenic state. Our study illustrates that HEXIM1 is a tumor suppressor that responds to cell stress, consequently inhibiting productive elongation of proliferative genes in melanoma."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57430GSE57433	Human Nonsense-Mediated RNA Decay Initiates Widely by Endonucleolysis and Targets snoRNA Host Genes	"Eukaryotic RNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs) are eliminated by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). While human nonsense RNA degradation can be initiated either by an endonucleolytic cleavage event near the PTC or through decapping, the individual contribution of these activities on endogenous substrates has remained unresolved. Here we unambiguously establish that SMG6-catalyzed endonucleolysis is the primary initiating step in human nonsense RNA decay. We also show that both protein-coding and non-coding genes hosting snoRNAs in their introns produce considerable amounts of NMD-sensitive splice variants, suggesting that these RNAs are merely by-products of a primary snoRNA production process. Finally, genes encoding multiple snoRNAs generally yield elevated numbers of alternative transcript isoforms, enabling the differential expression of individual snoRNAs. These findings demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential for decoupling of the individual expression levels of functional exon- and intron-encoded species from such composite genes. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This article was corrected in http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/30/9/1128.short Completely mapped 5'p-end sequencing data from the corrigendum have been updated in corresponding samples."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57433GSE57478	Treatment of multiple myeloma cells with EZH2 small molecule inhibitor	We investigated differential gene expression in response to treatment of multiple myeloma cells with EZH2 inhibitor	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57478GSE57480	Inducible PAX5 expression in a human B lymphoblastic leukemia cell line	"Hypomorphic mutations of the transcription factor PAX5 occur in one third of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs).

We interrogated the transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of IL-13-induced epithelial responses focusing on the chromatin activation marks H3K4me3, H3K9Ac, and H3K27Ac. ChIP-sequencing analysis revealed that IL-13inducible genes were epigenetically poised for induction and continued to accumulate epigenetic changes in response to IL-13. By intersecting the transcriptome and the epigenome of the IL-13 response, we identified neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1 (NTRK1) as a major target of IL-13 in epithelial cells. Using eosinophilic esophagitis as a model system for human allergic inflammation, we found that NTRK1 was dramatically induced in inflamed esophageal biopsies, and downstream mediators of NTRK1 signaling were elevated in diseased tissue. The NTRK1 ligand nerve growth factor (NGF) was constitutively expressed in control and disease states, indicating that induction of the receptor by IL-13 limited pathway activation. In epithelial cells, NGF and IL-13 synergistically induced transcription and secretion of the key eosinophil chemoattractant CCL26 (eotaxin-3). In summary, we demonstrate that IL-13mediated allergic responses are epigenetically driven and identify NTRK1 as a novel epigenetic and transcriptional target of IL-13 that uniquely contributes to allergic inflammation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57637GSE57662	Reprogramming of Endothelium Into Hematopoietic Progenitors by Defined Factors and Vascular Induction	"Generation of abundant engraftable hematopoietic cells from autologous tissues promises new therapies for hematologic diseases. Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into hematopoietic cells results in emergence of cells that have poor engraftment potential. To circumvent this hurdle, we have devised a vascular niche model to phenocopy the developmental microenvironment of hemogenic cells thereby enabling direct transcriptional reprogramming of human endothelial cells (ECs) into hematopoietic cells. In this approach, transduction of human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) or adult human dermal microvascular ECs (hDMECs) with transcription factors (TFs), FOSB, GFI1, RUNX1, and SPI1 (FGRS) and induction with a instructive vascular niche feeder layer in a xenobiotic- and serum-free microenvironment results in generation of long-term engraftable hematopoietic multilineage progenitors (rEC-HMLPs). The rEC-HMLPs had robust proliferative and multilineage colony forming units (CFU) potential, including granulocytic/monocytic, megakaryocytic, erythroid and lymphoid lineages. When transplanted, hDMEC-derived rEC-HMLPs were capable of long-term multilineage primary and secondary hematopoietic engraftment. A subset of engrafted rEC-HMLPs phenotypically and functionally resembled cord blood cells. By conditionally expressing the FGRS TFs, we further optimized reprogramming of ECs into rEC-HMLPs manifesting features of self-renewing multi-potent progenitor populations (MPPs). Our approach replicates critical aspects of hematopoietic development and essential role of vascular niche induction in orchestrating hematopoietic specification and may prove useful for engineering autologous engraftable hematopoietic cells for treatment of inherited and acquired blood disorders. ."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57662GSE57723	Modulation of the TNF-induced macrophage response by synovial fibroblasts	"Here we explored how the human macrophage response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is regulated by human synovial fibroblasts, the representative stromal cell type in the synovial lining of joints that become activated during inflammatory arthritis.

This represents the first step in the establishment of life-long viral latency in vivo and generates precursors that can develop into the lymphoid malignancies. However, virus spread requires a switch from latency to the lytic replication cycle, a process orchestrated by the virally encoded protein Zta, an AP1-like transcription factor that interacts with a 7 base-pair DNA sequence element. As Zta has the potential to reprogram the patterns of gene expression in the host cell, we undertook global transcriptome analyses (RNA sequencing) in a Burkitts lymphoma derived cell line in which the Zta is expressed from an inducible promoter, mimicking the switch from latency to lytic cycle. We identified 2,263 host genes whose expression levels were altered. In parallel, we performed chromatin precipitation and next-generation DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to identify genes that are direct targets of Zta. Integrating these data sets revealed 277 host genes that appear to be directly regulated by Zta. Surprisingly, the frequency and distribution of the Zta binding peaks suggests that Zta regulates host genes through long-range enhancers, with a median distance of 25.8kb from the transcriptional start site, rather than equivalents of the promoter elements through which Zta regulates viral genes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57732GSE57803	Gene Expression Signature in Adipose Tissue of Acromegaly Patients	"OBJECTIVE: Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disorder with excess growth hormone (GH) production. This disorder has important metabolic effects in insulin resistance and lipolysis. The objective of this study was to explore transcriptional changes induced by GH in adipose tissue. METHODS: The patients underwent clinical and metabolic profiling including assessment of HOMA-IR. Explants of adipose tissue were assayed ex-vivo for lipolysis and ceramide levels. Adipose tissue was analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). RESULTS: There was evidence of reduced insulin sensitivity based on the increase in fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR score. We observed several previously reported transcriptional changes (IGF1, IGFBP3) as well as several novel transcriptional changes, some of which may be important for GH signal regulation (PTPN3 and PTPN4) and the effect of GH on growth and proliferation. Several transcripts could potentially be important in GH-induced metabolic changes. Specifically, induction of LPL, ABHD5, and ACVR1C could contribute to enhanced lipolysis and may explain the suggestive enhancement of adipose tissue lipolysis in acromegaly patients as reflected by glycerol release from the explants of the two groups of patients (p=0.09). Higher expression of SCD and TCF7L2 could contribute to insulin resistance. Expression of HSD11B1 was reduced and GR was increased, predicting modified glucocorticoid activity in acromegaly. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the acromegaly gene expression signature in human adipose tissue.

One promising approach has been to increase the number or activity of brown-like adipocytes in white adipose depots, as this has been shown to prevent diet-induced obesity and reduce the incidence and severity of type 2 diabetes. Thus, the conversion of fat-storing cells into metabolically active thermogenic cells has become an appealing therapeutic strategy to combat obesity. Here, we report a screening platform for the identification of small molecules capable of promoting a white-to-brown metabolic conversion in human adipocytes. We identified two inhibitors of Janus Kinase (JAK) activity with no precedent in adipose tissue biology that permanently confer brown-like metabolic activity to white adipocytes.

"Cancer tissue-like structures were developed by using established human tumor cell lines in perfusion-based bioreactor systems. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, perfusion allowed more homogeneous scaffold seeding than tri-dimensional (3D) static cultures and significantly (13.7 fold, p<0.0001) higher proliferation. Resulting tissues exhibited morphology and phenotypes similar to xenografts generated in immunodeficient mice. Whole transcriptome analysis of 2D, 3D static and 3D perfusion cultures revealed the highest correlation between xenografts and 3D perfusion cultures (r=0.985). Clinically relevant concentrations of 5-FU, used in neo- and adjuvant CRC treatment, had no effect on numbers of HT-29 CRC cells cultured in 3D perfusion or xenografts, as compared with a 55.8%% reduction in 2D cultures. Treatment induced apoptosis in 2D cultures, but only nucleolar stress in perfused cells and xenografts, consistent with partial responsiveness. In 3D perfusion cultures BCL-2, TRAF1, and FLIP gene expression was marginally affected, as compared with significant down-regulation in 2D cell cultures. Accordingly, ABT-199 BCL-2 inhibitor, induced cytostatic effects in 3D perfusion but not in 2D cell cultures (p=0.003). Tumor cells from partially responsive (Dworak 2) patients undergoing neo-adjuvant treatment, typically (10/11) expressed BCL-2, as compared with 0/3 highly (Dworak 3-4) responsive and 4/15 fully resistant CRC (Dworak 0/1, p=0.03), closely matching 3D perfusion cultures data. These results indicate that 3D perfusion cultures efficiently mimic phenotypic and functional features observed in xenografts and clinical specimens. These models may be of critical translational relevance to address fundamental human tumor cell biology issues and to develop predictive pre-clinical tests of novel compounds."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57961GSE57973	Age-dependent gene expression changes in human islets	"We report the transcriptomic profiling of islet cell subtypes obtained from young and old human donors.

Although these retroelements are formidable motors of evolution, they can occasionally cause disease, and accordingly are inactivated during early embryogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms. In the mouse, at least for endogenous retroviruses, important mediators of this process are the tetrapod-specific KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) and their cofactor TRIM28. The present study demonstrates that KRAB/TRIM28-mediated regulation is responsible for controlling a very broad range of human-specific endogenous retroelements (EREs) in human embryonic stem (ES) cells and that it exerts, as a consequence, a marked effect on the transcriptional dynamics of these cells. It further reveals reciprocal dependence between TRIM28 recruitment at specific families of EREs and DNA methylation. It finally points to the importance of persistent TRIM28-mediated control of ERE transcriptional impact beyond their presumed inactivation by DNA methylation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57989GSE58008	Targeting c-MYC by antagonizing PP2A inhibitors in breast cancer	Inhibition of SET by siRNA or SET antagonist and CIP2A by siRNA can downregulate c-MYC and c-MYC target genes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58008GSE58107	Characterization of human CDK12 and CDK13 in the regulation of RNA processing	"We report the total RNA-seq results after CDK9, CDK12 and CDK13 depletion in human HCT116 cells for three days.

Over a period of 18 months, we performed intensive phenome-wide assessment of a single human, including brain connectivity using resting fMRI, measurements of psychological and physical health, and transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling. Brain connectivity varied across sessions in relation to behavioral variables including mood, fatigue, and food/caffeine intake, as well as variables related to inflammation and gut health. Pathway-based analysis of gene expression in peripheral lymphocytes identified associations with physical health and brain connectivity, including associations between specific brain networks and a broad set of immune-related pathways.

Here, we established patient-derived iPSCs from an Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) family and investigated the role of mutant p53 in the development of osteosarcoma (OS). Several members of this family carried a heterozygous p53(G245D) mutation and presented with a broad spectrum of tumors including OS. Osteoblasts (OBs) differentiated from iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) recapitulated OS features including defective osteoblastic differentiation (OB differentiation) as well as tumorigenic ability. Systematic analyses revealed that the expression of genes enriched in LFS-derived OBs strongly correlated with decreased time to tumor recurrence and poor patient survival. In silico cytogenetic region enrichment analysis (CREA) demonstrated that LFS-derived OBs do not have genomic rearrangements and hence are a particularly valuable tool for elucidating early oncogenic events prior to the accumulation of secondary alterations. LFS OBs exhibited impaired upregulation of the imprinted gene H19 during osteogenesis. Restoration of H19 expression in LFS OBs facilitated osteogenic differentiation and repressed tumorigenic potential. By integrating human imprinted gene network (IGN) and functional genomic analyses, we found that H19-mediates suppression of LFS-associated OS through the IGN component DECORIN (DCN). Downregulation of DCN impairs H19-mediated osteogenic differentiation and tumor suppression. In summary, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of studying inherited human cancer syndromes with iPSCs and also provide molecular insights into the role of the IGN in p53 mutation-mediated tumorigenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58123GSE58135	Breast Cancer RNA-seq	RNA-seq was performed on breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58135GSE58168	P493-6 treated with KJ-Pyr-9 and/or Doxycycline	"In a fluorescence polarization screen for MYC-MAX interaction, we have identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of MYC, KJ-Pyr-9, from a Krhnke pyridine library.

In addition, immunological imprinting of either tolerance or trained immunity after an initial infection determines the functional fate of innate immune cells and the susceptibility of the host to secondary infections. Here we comprehensively characterize the epigenetic profiles of these functional states relative to healthy adult nave monocytes. Inflammatory and metabolic pathways are strongly modulated in the derived macrophages, including decreased activation of inflammasome components. The cAMP-dependent signaling pathway is remodeled and adrenergic signaling was functionally implicated in trained innate immunity induction in vivo. Interestingly, -Glucan trains innate immune cells through extensive remodeling of distal regulatory region-bound histone acetylation, resulting in a sizeable exclusive epigenomic signature. Accordingly, genome-wide transcription factor footprint analysis reveals a specific transcription factor repertoire at trained cell-specific enhancers when recouped with epigenetic data, forming a rich hypothesis generator to manipulate innate immunity."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58310GSE58323	Evollutionally dynamic L1 regulation in embryonic stem cells	"Mobile elements are important evolutionary forces that challenge genomic integrity. Long interspersed element-1 (L1, also known as LINE-1) is the only autonomous transposon still active in the human genome. It displays an unusual pattern of evolution, with at any given time a single active L1 lineage amplifying to thousands of copies before getting replaced by a new lineage likely under pressure of host restriction factors, which act notably by silencing L1 expression during early embryogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) KAP1, the master co-factor of KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFP) previously implicated in the restriction of endogenous retroviruses, represses a discrete subset of L1 lineages predicted to have entered the ancestral genome between 26.8 and 7.6 million years ago. In the mouse, we documented a similar chronologically conditioned pattern, albeit with a much contracted time scale. We could further identify an L1-binding KRAB-ZFP, suggesting that this rapidly evolving protein family is more globally responsible for L1 recognition. KAP1 knockdown in hESC induced the expression of KAP1-bound L1 elements, but their younger, human-specific counterparts (L1Hs) were unaffected. Instead, they were stimulated by depleting DNA methyltransferases, consistent with recent evidence demonstrating that the PIWI-piRNA pathway regulates L1Hs in hESC. Altogether, these data indicate that the early embryonic control of L1 is an evolutionary dynamic process, and support a model whereby newly emerged lineages are first suppressed by DNA methylation-inducing small RNA-based mechanisms, before KAP1-recruiting protein repressors are selected."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58323GSE58326	Global analysis of ZNF217 chromatin occupancy in the breast cancer cell genome reveals an association with Eralpha	"Background: The ZNF217 gene, encoding a C2H2 zinc finger protein, is located at 20q13 and found amplified and overexpressed in greater than 20%% of breast tumors. Current studies indicate ZNF217 drives tumorigenesis, yet the regulatory mechanisms of ZNF217 are largely unknown. Because ZNF217 associates with chromatin modifying enzymes, we postulate that ZNF217 functions to regulate specific gene signaling networks. Here, we present a large-scale functional genomic analysis of ZNF217, which provides insights into the regulatory role of ZNF217 in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Results: ChIP-seq analysis reveals that the majority of ZNF217 binding sites are located at distal regulatory regions associated with the chromatin marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1. Analysis of ChIPseq transcription factor binding sites shows clustering of ZNF217 with FOXA1, GATA3 and ERalpha binding sites, supported by the enrichment of corresponding motifs for the ERalpha-associated cisregulatory sequences. ERalpha expression highly correlates with ZNF217 in lysates from breast tumors (n=15), and ERalpha co-precipitates ZNF217 and its binding partner CtBP2 from nuclear extracts. Transcriptome profiling following ZNF217 depletion identifies differentially expressed genes co-bound by ZNF217 and ERalpha; gene ontology suggests a role for ZNF217-ERalpha in expression programs associated with ER+ breast cancer studies found in the Molecular Signature Database. Data-mining of expression data from breast cancer patients correlates ZNF217 with reduced overall survival in multiple subtypes. Conclusions: Our genome-wide ZNF217 data suggests a functional role for ZNF217 at ERalpha target genes.

Here, we show that standard blood collection procedures rapidly change the transcriptional and post-transcriptional landscapes of hematopoietic cells, resulting in biased activation of specific biological pathways, up-regulation of pseudogenes, antisense RNAs, and unannotated coding isoforms, and RNA surveillance inhibition. Affected genes include common mutational targets and thousands of other genes participating in processes such as chromatin modification, RNA splicing, T and B cell activation, and NF-B signaling. The majority of published leukemic transcriptomes exhibit signals of this incubation-induced dysregulation, explaining up to 40%% of differences in gene expression and alternative splicing between leukemias and reference normal transcriptomes. The effects of sample processing are particularly evident in pan-cancer analyses. We provide biomarkers that detect prolonged incubation of individual samples, and show that keeping blood on ice markedly reduces changes to the transcriptome.

Alterations include four ligand binding pocket (LBP) mutations that define sites of inhibitor binding and four variants that confer constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, thus defining pivotal residues of SMO that ensure receptor autoinhibition.

SAMHD1 has been shown to possess a dGTP-dependent dNTP triphosphatase (dNTPase) activity and is proposed to inhibit HIV-1 replication by depleting the intracellular dNTP pool. Arguing against a role for SAMHD1 dNTPase in HIV-1 restriction, the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 regulates the restriction activity toward HIV-1 without affecting its ability to decrease cellular dNTP levels. Here, we show that SAMHD1 is a phospho-regulated RNase and that the RNase function is required for HIV-1 restriction. Mutation of the SAMHD1 D137 residue in the allosteric site (SAMHD1D137N) abolishes dNTPase activity but has no effect on RNase activity. This dNTPase-defective SAMHD1D137N mutant is able to restrict HIV-1 infection to nearly the same extent as wild-type SAMHD1. SAMHD1 associates with and degrades the HIV-1 genomic RNA during the early phases of infection. SAMHD1 silencing in macrophages and CD4+ T cells from healthy donors increases HIV-1 RNA stability, thus rendering the cells permissive for HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 at position T592 abolishes the RNase activity toward HIV-1 RNA, and consequently the ability of SAMHD1 to restrict HIV-1 infection, uncovering the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 T592 as a negative regulatory mechanism of RNase activity. Together, our results demonstrate that SAMHD1 is an essential RNase that prevents HIV-1 infection by directly degrading HIV-1 genomic RNA in a phosphorylation-regulated manner. The unique property of SAMHD1 that cleaves HIV-1 genomic RNA with no sequence preferences could be exploited to develop a new class of intervention for error-prone retroviruses."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58418GSE58434	Fatal Asthma vs. Control Human Airway Smooth Muscle Transcriptome Changes in Response to Vitamin D or Albuterol	"Rationale: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease.

Combined carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment of PDX tumors enriches the cancer stem cell populations, but persistent tumors are not entirely composed of these populations. RNA-Seq analysis of treated PDX tumors compared to untreated tumors demonstrates a consistently contrasting genetic profile after therapy, suggesting similar, but few, pathways are mediating chemoresistance.

In mammals most miRNA derive from the introns of protein coding genes where they exist as hairpin structures in the primary gene transcript, synthesized by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). These are cleaved co-transcriptionally by the Microprocessor complex, comprising DGCR8 and the RNase III endonuclease Drosha, to release the precursor (pre-)miRNA hairpin, so generating both miRNA and spliced messenger RNA1-4. However, a substantial minority of miRNA originate from Pol II-synthesized long non coding (lnc) RNA where transcript processing is largely uncharacterized5. Here, we show that most lnc-pri-miRNA do not use the canonical cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) transcription termination pathway6, but instead use Microprocessor cleavage both to release pre-miRNA and terminate transcription. We present a detailed characterization of one such lnc-pri-miRNA that generates the highly expressed liver-specific miR-1227. Genome-wide analysis then reveals that Microprocessor-mediated transcription termination is commonly used by lnc-pri-miRNA but not by protein coding miRNA genes. This identifies a fundamental difference between lncRNA and pre-mRNA processing. Remarkably, inactivation of the Microprocessor can lead to extensive transcriptional readthrough of lnc-pri-miRNA, resulting in inhibition of downstream genes by transcriptional interference. Consequently we define a novel RNase III-mediated, polyadenylation-independent mechanism of Pol II transcription termination in mammalian cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58838GSE58871	U2AF1 mutations alter splice site recognition in hematological malignancies	"Whole-exome sequencing studies have identified common mutations affecting genes encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery in hematological malignancies. Here, we sought to determine how mutations affecting the 3' splice site recognition factor U2AF1 altered its normal role in RNA splicing. We find that U2AF1 mutations influence the similarity of splicing programs in leukemias, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure. U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of hundreds of genes, affecting biological pathways implicated in myeloid disease such as DNA methylation (DNMT3B), X chromosome inactivation (H2AFY), the DNA damage response (ATR, FANCA), and apoptosis (CASP8). We show that U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3' splice site motif in vivo, in cell culture, and in vitro. Mutations affecting the first and second zinc fingers give rise to different alterations in splice site preference and largely distinct downstream splicing programs. These allele-specific effects are consistent with a computationally predicted model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA. Our findings suggest that U2AF1 mutations contribute to pathogenesis by causing quantitative changes in splicing that affect diverse cellular pathways, and give insight into the normal function of U2AF1s zinc finger domains."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58871GSE58910	Transcriptome analysis of oxdative-stress induced senescence in human astrocytes	"Purpose: Cellular senescence is a cell stress response resulting in permanent growth arrest and the production of an altered pro-inflammatory secretory profile known as the senescecnce-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The induction of senescence in astrocytes, a cell type responsible for maintaining homeostasis within the central nervous system (CNS) and responding to CNS insults, has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. However, little is known about the senescent transcriptome in CNS-derived cell types including astrocytes. Methods: To better understand senescence-associated gene expression changes in astrocytes, we investigated global changes in the astrocyte transcriptome using RNA-seq following the induction of oxidative stress-induced senescence with hydrogen peroxide. Results: During senescence, we find evidence of a loss of brain expressed transcripts involved in diverse CNS processes including neuronal differentiation and development, gliogenesis, axonogenesis, and learning and memory as well as a loss of transcripts involved in MHC class II antigen processing and presentation. In addition, we find evidence for induction of the senescent phenotype including a loss of transcripts involved in cell division and an increase in the mRNA level of inflammatory mediators suggestive of a SASP. Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest a loss of differentiated function in senescent astrocytes and a gain in neuroinflammatory function as part of the SASP as a potential mechanisms for dysfunction in the aging brain."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58910GSE58933	Hyper-excitability of Neurons generated from Patients with Bipolar Disorder	"Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania and depression and, without treatment, 15%% of patients commit suicide1. Hence, among all diseases, BD has been ranked by the WHO as a top disorder of morbidity and lost productivity2. Previous neuropathological studies have revealed a series of alterations in the brains of BD patients or animal models3, such as reduced glial cell number in the patient prefrontal cortex4, up-regulated activities of the PKA/PKC pathways5-7, and changes in dopamine/5-HT/glutamate neurotransmission systems8-11. However, the roles and causation of these changes in BD are too complex to exactly determine the pathology of the disease; none of the current BD animal models can recapitulate both the manic and depressive phenotypes or spontaneous cycling of BD simultaneously12,13. Furthermore, while some patients show remarkable improvement with lithium treatment, for yet unknown reasons, other patients are refractory to lithium treatment. Therefore, developing an accurate and powerful biological model has been a challenge for research into BD. The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has provided such a new approach. Here, we developed a human BD iPSC model and investigated the cellular phenotypes of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons derived from the patient iPSCs. Using patch clamp recording, somatic Ca2+ imaging and RNA-seq techniques, we found that the neurons derived from BD patients exhibited hyperactive action potential (AP) firing, up-regulated expression of PKA/PKC/AP and mitochondria-related genes. Moreover, lithium selectively reversed these alterations in the neurons of patients who responded to lithium treatment. Therefore, hyper-excitability is one endophenotype of BD that is probably achieved through enhancement in the PKA/PKC and Na+ channel signaling systems, and our BD iPSC model can be used to develop new therapies and drugs aimed at clinical treatment of this disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58933GSE58966	GATA2 shRNA Expression in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines	The transcription factor GATA2 regulates chemotherapy resistance in prostate cancer.

We identified the genomic occupancy sites of DACOR1 through ChIRP-seq, which we found to significantly overlap with known differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in colon tumors. Induction of DACOR1 in colon cancer cell lines significantly reduced their ability to form colonies in vitro, suggesting a growth suppressor function. Consistent with the observed phenotype, induction of DACOR1 led to the activation of tumor-suppressor pathways and attenuation of cancer-associated metabolic pathways. Notably, DACOR1 induction resulted in down-regulation of Cystathionine -synthase (CBS), which is known to lead to increased levels of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)  the key methyl donor for DNA methylation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58989GSE59020	ETS1 is a genome-wide effector of RAS/ERK signaling in epithelial cells (RNA-Seq)	ETS1 and RAS/ERK regulate a common gene expression program in establishing enviroment suitable for prostate cancer cell migration.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59020GSE59066	"RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of sarcomatoid (E/S), rhabdoid (E/R) and non-sarcomatoid (E*) clear cell renal cell carcinoma"	"The biphasic epithelioid (E-) and sarcomatoid(S-) components of sarcomatoid RCC and epithelioid (E-) and rhabdoid (R-) components of rhabdoid RCC shared a similar transcriptomic signature, despite morphologic differences; by contrast, the transcriptome of sarcomatoid and rhabdoid RCC was sharply distinct from non-sarcomatoid RCC."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59066GSE59089	RNA-seq transcriptional profiling in primary human erythroid progenitor cells upon shRNA-mediated knockdown of PRC2 core subunits	"Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays crucial roles in transcriptional regulation and stem cell development. However, the context-specific functions associated with alternative subunits remain largely unexplored. Here we show that the related enzymatic subunits EZH1 and EZH2 undergo an expression switch during hematopoiesis. We examine the in vivo stoichiometry of the PRC2 complexes by quantitative proteomics and reveal the existence of an EZH1-SUZ12 sub-complex lacking EED. We provide evidence that EZH1 together with SUZ12 form a non-canonical PRC2 complex, occupy active chromatin domains in the absence of H3K27me3, and positively regulate gene expression. Loss of EZH2 expression leads to global repositioning of EZH1 chromatin occupancy to EZH2 targets. Moreover, we demonstrate that an erythroid-specific enhancer mediates transcriptional activation of EZH1, and a switch from GATA2 to GATA1 controls the developmental EZH1/2 switch by differential association with EZH1 enhancers during erythropoiesis. Thus, the lineage- and developmental stage-specific regulation of PRC2 expression and subunit composition leads to a switch from canonical silencing to non-canonical PRC2 functions during blood stem cell specification."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59089GSE59093	DDX3X regulation of global translation is impaired by medulloblastoma-associated mutations [RNA-Seq]	"Whole-genome sequencing recently identified recurrent missense mutations in the RNA helicase DDX3X in pediatric medulloblastoma (MB) and other tumors. The normal function of DDX3X is poorly understood, and the consequences of its cancer-associated mutations have not been explored. Here we used genomic, biochemical, cell biological, and animal modeling approaches to investigate normal DDX3X function and the impact of cancer-associated DDX3X mutations. Cross-linking immunoprecipitationhigh-throughput sequencing (CLIPseq) analyses revealed that DDX3X binds primarily to ~1000 mature mRNA targets at binding sites spanning the full mRNA length; their enrichment in the coding regions suggests that DDX3X plays a role in translational elongation. The association of wild-type DDX3X with polysomes is consistent with this observation. Cancer-associated mutations result in loss of DDX3X from polysomes and accumulation of mutant DDX3X in stress granules (cytoplasmic accumulations of translationally arrested mRNAs). Mutation-dependent redistribution of DDX3X to stress granules is also observed in a Drosophila model system and in MB tumor cells from patients carrying DDX3X mutations. Importantly, mRNAs targeted by DDX3X are enriched in translation factors, suggesting that DDX3X regulates translation both directly and indirectly. Indeed, depletion of DDX3X by RNAi or over-expression of mutant DDX3X significantly impairs global protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling confirmed this observation and showed a 5 bias in ribosomal occupancy, further confirming the role of DDX3X in translational elongation. Together, our data show that DDX3X is a key regulator of translation and that this function is impaired by cancer-associated mutations. Finally, we found that medulloblastoma-related mutant DDX3X can efficiently bind the wild-type form suggesting that mutant DDX3X could exert a dominant negative effect in vivo."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59093GSE59100	Molecular mechanism underlying increased ischemic damage in the ALDH2*2 genetic polymorphism using a human iPSC model system	"We investigated the ALDH2*2 genetic polymorphism and its underlying mechanisms for the first time in a human model system of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) generated from individuals carrying the most common heterozygous form of the ALDH2*2 genotype. We showed that the ALDH2*2 mutation confers elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and toxic aldehydes such as 4HNE, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptotic signaling pathways, especially during ischemic injury. ALDH2 exerts control of cell survival decisions via modulation of oxidative stress levels. This regulatory circuitry was found to be dysfunctional in the loss-of-function ALDH2*2 genotype, causing upregulation of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes following ischemic insult. These results reveal a novel function of the metabolic enzyme ALDH2 in modulation of cell survival decisions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59100GSE59233	Impaired DNA damage metabolism promotes autoimmunity in TREX1 deficiency	"Constitutive low level DNA damage is linked to innate immune activation.

We found the genes with expression changes in autism are significantly overlapped with genes showing human-specific developmental profile. A major pattern of the overlapped genes reflects the aberrant acceleration of synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation followed by premature synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex of autism patients. This pattern involves the same developmental program that controls human-specific extension of cortical synaptogenesis in healthy individuals.

It has roles including establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, differentiation, migration and signalling in cell proliferation pathways. Its downregulation is commonly observed in epithelial tumours and is a hallmark of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Methods: To improve our understanding of how E-cadherin loss contributes to tumorigenicity, we investigated the impact of its elimination from the non-tumorigenic breast cell line MCF10A. We performed cell-based assays and whole genome RNAseq to characterize an isogenic MCF10A cell line that is devoid of CDH1 expression due to an engineered homozygous 4bp deletion in CDH1 exon 11. Results: The E-cadherin-deficient line, MCF10A CDH1-/- showed subtle morphological changes, weaker cell-substrate adhesion, delayed migration, but retained cell-cell contact, contact growth inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth. Within the cytoskeleton, the apical microtubule network in the CDH1-deficient cells lacked the radial pattern of organization present in the MCF10A cells and F-actin formed thicker, more numerous stress fibres in the basal part of the cell. Whole genome RNAseq identified compensatory changes in the genes involved in cell-cell adhesion while genes involved in cell-substrate adhesion, notably ITGA1, COL8A1, COL4A2 and COL12A1, were significantly downregulated. Key EMT markers including CDH2, FN1, VIM and VTN were not upregulated although increased expression of proteolytic matrix metalloprotease and kallikrein genes was observed. Conclusions: Overall, our results demonstrated that E-cadherin loss alone was insufficient to induce an EMT or enhance transforming potential in the non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells but was associated with broad transcriptional changes associated with tissue remodelling."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59317GSE59335	Investigation into human Tra2 protein-dependent splicing in MDA-MB-231 cells using iCLIP and RNA-seq	"Alternative splicingthe production of multiple mRNA isoforms from a single geneis regulated in part by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).

The repressed genes function in pivotal processes - including antigen-presentation, extracellular-signal detection, signal-transduction and lipid-mediator biosynthesis - underscoring the central contribution of the silencing mechanism to rapid reshaping of DC-function.

We show that UBL5 is required for sister chromatid cohesion maintenance in human cells. UBL5 primarily associates with spliceosomal proteins, and UBL5 depletion decreases pre-mRNA splicing efficiency, leading to globally enhanced intron retention. Defective sister chromatid cohesion is a general consequence of dysfunctional pre-mRNA splicing, resulting from the selective downregulation of the cohesion protection factor Sororin. As the UBL5 yeast orthologue, Hub1, also promotes spliceosome functions, our results show that UBL5 plays an evolutionary conserved role in pre-mRNA splicing, the integrity of which is essential for the fidelity of chromosome segregation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59376GSE59386	Human intestinal DC and MNP	"Parallel subpopulations of CD11c+ MNPs present in the mouse intestine similarly exist in the human intestine (Fig. 6A and Ref.

In contrast to CD103+ DCs, CD14+ MNPs expressed CD64 as well as higher levels of CD86. Consistent with the phenotypic characterization of these subsets, transcriptional analysis of these populations by RNA-seq revealed higher levels of CLEC9A, XCR1, and CD207 expression in the CD103+ cells, while MERTK, STAB1, and CX3CR1 were higher in the CD14+ cells (Fig. 6C). We tested the potential of these subsets to induce IL-22 production by co-culturing TLR-stimulated CD14+ MNPs and CD103+ DCs from human intestinal resections with intestinal ILCs. Intracellular cytokine staining at 18 hours revealed that the CD14+ MNP were more effective than the CD103+ DCs at stimulating IL-22 production by ILCs (Fig. 6D).

We have used global nuclear run-on coupled with deep sequencing to characterize the immediate transcriptional responses of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with estradiol, TNF, or both. In addition, we have integrated these data with chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing for estrogen receptor alpha (ER), the pioneer factor FoxA1 and the p65 subunit of the NF-B transcription factor. Our results indicate extensive transcriptional interplay between these two signaling pathways, which is observed for a number of classical mitogenic and proinflammatory protein-coding genes. In addition, GRO-seq has allowed us to capture the transcriptional crosstalk at the genomic locations encoding for long non-coding RNAs, a poorly characterized class of RNAs which have been shown to play important roles in cancer outcomes. The synergistic and antagonistic interplay between estrogen and TNF signaling at the gene level is also evident in the patterns of ER and NF-B binding, which relocalize to new binding sites that are not occupied by either treatment alone. Interestingly, the chromatin accessibility of classical ER binding sites is predetermined prior to estrogen treatment, whereas ER binding sites gained upon co-treatment with TNF require NF-B and FoxA1 to promote chromatin accessibility de novo. Our data suggest that TNF signaling recruits FoxA1 and NF-B to latent ER enhancer locations and directly impact ER enhancer accessibility. Binding of ER to latent enhancers upon co-treatment, results in increased enhancer transcription, target gene expression and altered cellular response. This provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the molecular basis for integration of mitogenic and proinflammatory signaling in breast cancer."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59531GSE59598	mRNA expression in human DAOY cells	"We generate ZNF423 knockdown and control DAOY cells with lentivirus that co-expressed the fluorescent protein mCherry.

However, its regulatory roles in mTORC1-mediated translation remain unclear. PAR-CLIP of LARP1 revealed its direct and dynamic interactions with RP mRNAs through pyrimidine-enriched sequences in the 5UTR of RP mRNAs when mTOR activity is inhibited. Importantly, this LARP1 is a direct substrate of mTORC1 and S6K1/Akt, and phosphorylated LARP1 scaffolds mTORC1 on translation-competent mRNAs to facilitate 4EBP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation. Ablation of LARP1 causes multiple defects in the processes of translation including abnormal eIF4G1 interaction with RP mRNAs and inefficient RP mRNA elongation thereby reducing ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. These observations illustrate that LARP1 functions both an effector and a regulator for local mTORC1 activity, and acts as a molecular switch for ribosome biogenesis by sensing growth factor/nutrient signaling."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59599GSE59612	MRI-localized biopsies reveal subtype-specific differences in molecular and cellular composition at the margins of glioblastoma	"We obtained radiographically-localized biopsies during glioma resection surgeries to sample the tumor core and margins from multiple glioma patients.

Here we identify TUT4 and TUT7 (also known as ZCCHC11 and ZCCHC6, respectively) as the enzymes that uridylate mRNAs. Uridylation readily occurs on deadenylated mRNAs that are not associated with poly(A) binding protein (PABPC1) in cells. Consistently, purified TUT4 and TUT7 (TUT4/7) selectively uridylate RNAs with short A tails (< ~25 nt) while PABPC1 antagonizes uridylation of polyadenylated mRNAs in vitro. In cells depleted of TUT4/7, the vast majority of mRNAs lose the U tails, and their half-lives are extended. Suppression of mRNA decay factors leads to the accumulation of uridylated mRNAs. In line with this, microRNA induces uridylation of its targets, and TUT4/7 is required for enhanced decay of microRNA targets. Our study explains the mechanism underlying selective uridylation of deadenylated mRNAs, and demonstrates a fundamental role of the U tail as a molecular mark for global mRNA decay."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59626GSE59688	Adenovirus Small E1A Employs the Lysine Acetylases p300/CBP and Tumor Suppressor Rb to Repress Select Host Genes and Promote Productive Virus Infection [RNA-seq]	"Oncogenic transformation by adenovirus small e1a depends on simultaneous interactions with the host lysine acetylases p300/CBP and the tumor suppressor RB.

These repressing p300-e1a-RB1 complexes specifically interact with host genes that have unusually high p300 association within the gene body. The TGF?-, TNF-, and interleukin-signaling pathway components are enriched among such p300-targeted genes. The p300-e1a-RB1 complex condenses chromatin in a manner dependent on HDAC activity, p300 lysine acetylase activity, the p300 bromodomain, and RB K873/K874 and e1a K239 acetylation to repress host genes that would otherwise inhibit productive virus infection. Thus, adenovirus employs e1a to repress host genes that interfere with viral replication."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59688GSE59717	Wide-spread disruption of transcription termination in HSV-1 infection: Next generation sequencing of total and newly transcribed (4sU-RNA) RNA	Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were infected with wild-type simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) strain 17 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10.

This process is dependent on the coordinated expression of many genes that encode proteins with a role in epithelial transport. We previously generated genome-wide maps of open chromatin in primary human fetal epididymis epithelial cells to identify potential regulatory elements controlling coordinated gene expression in the epididymis epithelium. Subsequent in silico analysis identified transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) that were over-represented in the HEE open chromatin, include the motif for paired box 2 (PAX2). PAX2 is a critical transcriptional regulator of urogenital tract development, which is well studied in the kidney but is unexplored in the epididymis. Due to the limited lifespan of primary HEE cells in culture we investigated the role of PAX2 in an immortalized HEE cell line (REP). First, REP cells were evaluated by DNase-seq and their open chromatin map overlapped that of primary HEE cells at ~ 65%% of sites. Moreover, the PAX2-binding motif was again identified as an overrepresented TFBS within intergenic open chromatin, though on fewer chromosomes than in the primary HEE cells. To identify PAX2-target genes in REP cells, RNA-seq analysis was performed after siRNA-mediated depletion of PAX2 in comparison to a non-targeting siRNA. In response to PAX2-represssion, 3142 transcripts were differentially expressed (1334 up-regulated and 1808 down-regulated). Novel PAX2 targets included multiple genes encoding proteins with a predicted function in the epididymis epithelium."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59781GSE59810	Discovery of biomarkers predictive of GSI response in triple negative breast cancer and adenoid cystic carcinoma	"Next generation sequencing was used to identify Notch mutations in a large collection of diverse solid tumors. NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 rearrangements leading to constitutive receptor activation were confined to triple negative breast cancers (TNBC, 6 of 66 tumors). TNBC cell lines with NOTCH1 rearrangements associated with high levels of activated NOTCH1 (N1-ICD) were sensitive to the gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) MRK-003, both alone and in combination with pacitaxel, in vitro and in vivo, whereas cell lines with NOTCH2 rearrangements were resistant to GSI. Immunohistochemical staining of N1-ICD in TNBC xenografts correlated with responsiveness, and expression levels of the direct Notch target gene HES4 correlated with outcome in TNBC patients. Activating NOTCH1 point mutations were also identified in other solid tumors, including adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Notably, ACC primary tumor xenografts with activating NOTCH1 mutations and high N1-ICD levels were sensitive to GSI, whereas N1-ICD low tumors without NOTCH1 mutations were resistant."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59810GSE59820	Ribosome profiling on sections taken from a kidney tumor	Ribosome profiling on sections taken from a kidney tumor	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59820GSE59822	Transcription factor p63 bookmarks genomic loci in epithelial cells and regulates a subset of target genes during epidermal differentiation through dynamic enhancers (RNA-Seq)	"Tightly controlled gene expression orchestrated by the transcription factor p63 during epithelial differentiation is important for development of epithelial-related structures such as epidermis, limb and craniofacial regions. How p63 regulates spatial and temporal expression of its target genes during these developmental processes is however not yet clear. By epigenomics profiling in stem cells established from one of these epithelial structures, the epidermis, we provide a global map of p63-bound regulatory elements that are categorized as single enhancers and clustered enhancers during epidermal differentiation. Transcriptomics analysis shows dynamic gene expression patterns during epidermal differentiation that correlates with the activity of p63-bound enhancers rather than with p63 binding itself. Only a subset of p63-bound enhancers is active in epidermal stem cells, and inactive p63-bound enhancers appear to function in gene regulation during the development of other epithelial tissues. Our data suggest a paradigm that p63 bookmarks genomic loci during the commitment of the epithelial lineage and regulates gene expression in different epithelial tissues through tissue-specific active enhancers.

However, no genome-wide investigations into their binding speci- ficity have been performed. We have created six- finger ATFs to target two different 18 nt regions of the human SOX2 promoter; each ATF is constructed such that it contains or lacks a super KRAB do- main (SKD) that interacts with a complex contain- ing repressive histone methyltransferases. ChIP-seq analysis of the effector-free ATFs in MCF7 breast cancer cells identified thousands of binding sites, mostly in promoter regions; the addition of an SKD domain increased the number of binding sites 5- fold, with a majority of the new sites located out- side of promoters. De novo motif analyses suggest that the lack of binding specificity is due to sub- sets of the finger domains being used for genomic interactions. Although the ATFs display widespread binding, few genes showed expression differences; genes repressed by the ATF-SKD have stronger bind- ing sites and are more enriched for a 12 nt motif. Interestingly, epigenetic analyses indicate that the transcriptional repression caused by the ATF-SKD is not due to changes in active histone modifications."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59980GSE59987	TET1 regulates hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition through DNA demethylation (RNA-Seq)	"In order to explore the status of DNA methylation in hypoxia response, we show that TET1, a DNA dioxygenase converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), regulates hypoxia-responsive gene expression.

Apparent ribosome footprints outside of protein-coding regions raise the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here we show hallmarks of translation in these footprints: co-purification with the large ribosomal subunit, response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation at early AUGs. We develop a metric for distinguishing between 80S footprints and nonribosomal sources using footprint size distributions, which validates the vast majority of footprints outside of coding regions. We present evidence for polypeptide production beyond annotated genes, including induction of immune responses following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection.

However, without a tractable experimental model, the mechanism of human PGC (hPGC) specification remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate specification of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) from germline competent pluripotent stem cells. The characteristics of hPGCLCs are consistent with the embryonic hPGCs and a germline seminoma that share a CD38 cell-surface marker, which collectively defines likely progression of the early human germline. Remarkably, SOX17 is the key regulator of hPGC-like fate, whereas BLIMP1 represses endodermal and other somatic genes during specification of hPGCLCs. Notable mechanistic differences between mouse and human PGC specification could be attributed to their divergent embryonic development and pluripotent states, which might affect other early cell-fate decisions.

Over 200,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the USA, with approximately 40,000 of these cases resulting in death. HER2-positive (HER2+) breast tumors, representing 2030 %% of early-stage breast cancer diagnoses, are characterized by the amplification of the HER2 gene. However, the critical genes and pathways that become affected by HER2 amplification in humans are yet to be specifically identified. Furthermore, it is yet to be determined if HER2 amplification also affects the expression of long intervening non-coding (linc)RNAs, which are involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We examined changes in gene expression by next generation RNA sequencing in human tumors pre- and post- HER2 inhibition by trastuzumab in vivo, and changes in gene expression in response to HER2 knock down in cell culture models. We integrated our results with gene expression analysis of HER2+ tumors vs matched normal tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The integrative analyses of these datasets led to the identification of a small set of mRNAs, and the associated biological pathways that become deregulated by HER2 amplification. Furthermore, our analyses identified three lincRNAs that become deregulated in response to HER2 amplification both in vitro and in vivo. Our results should provide the foundation for functional studies of these candidate mRNAs and lincRNAs to further our understanding of how HER2 amplification results in tumorigenesis. Also, the identified lincRNAs could potentially open the door for future RNA-based biomarkers and therapeutics in HER2+ breast cancer."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60182GSE60191	Acetylation-Dependent Control of Global Poly(A) RNA Degradation by CBP/p300 and HDAC1/2	"Acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases regulate gene expression at the level of chromatin, mainly by affecting transcription. In this study, we report that hyperacetylation induced by inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) causes massive degradation of mRNA. The effect is promoter-independent and affects poly-A mRNA globally. HDAC inhibition leads to the removal of poly-A tails from mRNAs through activation of the deadenylase CAF1a, which we find to be acetylated together with its activator BTG2 by the histone acetyl transferases (HATs) p300 and CBP. By mutation of critical lysine residues, we provide evidence that acetylation of CAF1a and BTG2 induces enhanced poly-A mRNA degradation. Our study reveals a fundamental mechanism by which cells coordinate epigenetic and transcriptional control of gene expression with posttranscriptional control of poly-A mRNA stability. In this experiment, HeLa cells were exposed to the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) for 16 hours, followed by treatment with actinomycin D. Total RNA was isolated after 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours, and analysed by RNA sequencing. The half-lives of 7431 RNAs were calculated after normalization to rRNA (18S + 28S) levels.

A variety of mechanisms involving both the innate and adaptive immune systems have been proposed to contribute to these deficiencies. The emergence of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as an accurate and quantitative method for examining mRNA levels provides an opportunity to compare transcriptional responses to a stimulus at a global scale in neonates, adults, and older adults. An examination of ex vivo monocyte responses to lipopolysaccharide stimulation or Listeria monocytogenes infection (with cord blood monocytes representing neonatal monocytes) revealed extensive similarities between all three age groups, with only a small number of genes exhibiting statistically significant differences. Using transcription factor motif analyses and RNA-seq data sets from a variety of mouse mutants, the most significant neonatal deficiencies corresponded to genes that require interferon response factor-3 or type 1 interferon signaling for their activation. In older adults, the most striking difference was broad, low-level activation of inflammatory genes prior to stimulation, consistent with prior evidence of a chronic inflammatory state in older adults.

However, the role of A-to-I RNA editing in vascular disease is unknown. Here we show that cathepsin S mRNA (CTSS), which encodes a cysteine protease associated with angiogenesis and atherosclerosis, is highly edited in human endothelial cells. The 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) of the CTSS transcript contains two inverted repeats, the AluJo and AluSx+ regions, which form a long stemloop structure that is recognized by ADAR1 as a substrate for editing. RNA editing enables the recruitment of the stabilizing RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR; encoded by ELAVL1) to the 3 UTR of the CTSS transcript, thereby controlling CTSS mRNA stability and expression. In endothelial cells, ADAR1 overexpression or treatment of cells with hypoxia or with the inflammatory cytokines interferon- and tumor-necrosis-factor- induces CTSS RNA editing and consequently increases cathepsin S expression. ADAR1 levels and the extent of CTSS RNA editing are associated with changes in cathepsin S levels in patients with atherosclerotic vascular diseases, including subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysms and advanced carotid atherosclerotic disease.

Here, we examine by RNAseq proliferating ASCs (Day -2 prior to adipogenic induction), confluent ASCs (Day 0, adipogenic induction), pre-adipocytes (Day 3) and maturing adipocytes (Day 9). We find 1060, 5452 and 2216 genes differentially expressed between D-2/D0, D0/D3 and D3/D9 respectively. We identify gene clusters with distinct and dynamic expression patterns. In particular, adipogenic induction is marked by temporal waves of gene induction and downregulation. We report two types of transcriptional waves: (i) those showing transient induction or inactivation at D0, D3 or D9, and involved in sensory perception and immune response functions; and (ii) those showing long-lived induction or repression at these time points. Our data reveal a dynamic network of gene regulation during adipogenesis, involving signaling, immune and developmental processes. We identify 15 unique epigenetic states using Hidden Markov Modeling which reflects an epigenetically highly organised genome showing enhancer states are commonly consecutive.

We refer to enhancers recruiting these factors as mega transcription factor-bound in trans (MegaTrans) enhancers. The MegaTrans complex is a signature of the most potent functional enhancers and is required for activation of enhancer RNA transcription and recruitment of coactivators, including p300 and Med1. The MegaTrans complex functions, in part, by recruiting specific enzymatic machinery, exemplified by DNA-dependent protein kinase.

Although X-inactivation can be reversed in vitro by reprogramming, the extent varies according to species, operator and conditions. Here, we have reprogrammed cloned female human fibroblasts by fusing them with mouse ESCs and examined the kinetics of X-linked gene re-expression. Allele-specific RNA sequencing analysis was used to determine the expression from the inactive X chromosome. This study revealed that a subset of loci within domains prone to escape X-inactivation, or that showed variable expression between somatic clones, were consistently reactivated upon pluripotent reprogramming.

Here, we extend the global steady-state measurements to additional mammalian contexts and find that regardless of the miRNA, cell type, growth condition, or translational state, mRNA destabilization explains most (66%%>90%%) miRNA-mediated repression. We also determine the relative dynamics of translational repression and mRNA destabilization for endogenous mRNAs as a miRNA is induced. Although translational repression occurs rapidly, its effect is relatively weak, such that by the time consequential repression ensues, the effect of mRNA destabilization dominates. These results imply that consequential miRNA-mediated repression is largely irreversible and provide other insights into the nature of miRNA-mediated regulation.

All-Trans Retinoic Acid treatment of t(16;21) cells as well as FUS-ERG knock down alleviate the myeloid differentiation block. Together, the results suggest that FUS-ERG acts as a transcriptional repressor of the retinoic acid signaling pathway."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60477GSE60481	Identification of novel gene signatures in patients with atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum	"Background: A subset of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is prone to disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, i.e. eczema herpeticum (ADEH+). Biomarkers that identify ADEH+ are lacking. Objective: To search for novel ADEH+ gene signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Methods: A RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) approach was applied to evaluate global transcriptional changes using PBMCs from ADEH+ and AD without a history of EH (ADEH-). Candidate genes were confirmed by qPCR or ELISA. Results: ADEH+ PBMCs had distinct changes to the transcriptome when compared to ADEH- PBMCs following HSV-1 stimulation: 792 genes were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 (ANOVA), and 15 type I and type III interferon (IFN) genes were among the top 20 most down-regulated genes in ADEH+. We further validated that IFN- and IL-29 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in HSV-1 stimulated PBMCs from ADEH+ compared to ADEH- and normal. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) demonstrated that the up-stream regulators of type I and type III IFNs, IRF3 and IRF7 was significantly inhibited in ADEH+ based on the down-regulation of their target genes. Furthermore, we found that gene expression of IRF3 and IRF7 were significantly decreased in HSV-1 stimulated PBMC from ADEH+ subjects. Conclusions: PBMCs from ADEH+ have a distinct immune response following HSV-1 exposure compared to ADEH- . Inhibition of the IRF3 and IRF7 innate immune pathways in ADEH+ may be the important mechanisms for increased susceptibility to disseminated viral infection."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60481GSE60482	Stretch-Enhancers Delineate Disease-Associated Regulatory Nodes in T Cells	T Cell stretch-enhancers are vulnerable to Jak inhibitor tofacitinib	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60482GSE60529	mRNA expression in HEK-293 /STF cells	"Canonical Wnt signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) is required for vascularization of the central nervous system (CNS) and for formation and maintenance of barrier properties unique to CNS vasculature. Gpr124 is an orphan member of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor family that is expressed in ECs and is essential for CNS angiogenesis and barrier formation via an unknown mechanism. Using canonical Wnt signaling assays in cell culture and genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments in mice, we show that Gpr124 functions as a co-activator of Wnt7a- and Wnt7b-stimulated canonical Wnt signaling via a Frizzled receptor and Lrp co-receptor, and that Gpr124-stimulated signaling functions in concert with Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling to control CNS vascular development.

Using U87-MG human glioblastoma xenografts, we observed that overexpression of KPC1 results in strong inhibition of tumor growth mediated via excessive generation of p50.The goal of this RNASeq study was to analyze the profile of gene expression in xenografts overexpressing control (V0), KPC1 or p50 vectors, and to further understand how the altered gene expression patterns can explain the tumor suppressive effect we observed. Results:Transcript analysis of U87-MG xenografts overexpressing control (V0), KPC1 or p50 vector mapped to the human genome revealed:  A strong similarity between overexpression of p50 and KPC1 (correlation of 0.51, p-value<10-300 )  A specific signature of NF-kB targets [21 of the consistently changed genes are known to be regulated by NF-kB (p-value<3.410-9 )]  A significant (p-value<1.410-18) increase in the expression of 40 tumor suppressor genes, with no significant change in other classes.  A significant down regulation of a cluster of genes including LIN28B, IL-6, HMAGA2 and VEGFA.

However, it remains challenging to elucidate the underlying regulatory programs because differentiation protocols are laborious and often result in low neuron yields. Here, we overexpressed two murine Neurogenin transcription factors in human induced pluripotent stem cells, and obtained neurons with bipolar morphology in four days at greater than 90%% purity. The high purity enabled mRNA and microRNA expression profiling during neurogenesis, thus revealing the genetic programs involved in the transition from stem cell to neuron.

"An unbalanced karyotype, a condition known as aneuploidy, has a profound impact on cellular physiology and is a hallmark of cancer. Determining how aneuploidy affects cells is thus critical to understanding tumorigenesis. Here we show that aneuploidy interferes with the degradation of autophagosomes within lysosomes. Mis-folded proteins that accumulate in aneuploid cells due to aneuploidy-induced proteomic changes overwhelm the lysosome with cargo, leading to the observed lysosomal degradation defects. Importantly, aneuploid cells respond to lysosomal saturation. They activate a lysosomal stress pathway that specifically increases the expression of genes needed for autophagy-mediated protein degradation. Our results reveal lysosomal saturation as a universal feature of the aneuploid state that must be overcome during tumorigenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60570GSE60585	Integrator complex regulates NELF-mediated RNA Polymerase II pause/release and processivity at coding genes [RNA-seq]	"RNAPII pausing/termination shortly after initiation is a hallmark of gene regulation. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are still to be uncovered. Here, we show that NELF interacts with Integrator complex subunits (INTScom) forming a stable complex with RNPII and Spt5. The interaction between NELF and INTScom subunits is RNA and DNA independent. Using both HIV-1 promoter and genome wide analyses, we demonstrate that Integrator subunits specifically control NELF-mediated RNAPII pause/release at coding genes. The strength of RNAPII pausing is determined by the nature of the NELF-associated complex. Interestingly, in addition to controlling RNAPII pause release INTS11 catalytic subunit of the INTScom is required for the synthesis of full length mRNA. Finally, INTScom-target genes are enriched in HIV-1 TAR/ NELF-binding element and in a 3box sequence required for snRNA biogenesis. Revealing these unexpected functions of INTScom in regulating RNAPII pausing/release and completion of mRNA synthesis of NELF-target genes will contribute to our understanding of the gene expression cycle."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60585GSE60590	Dynamics of the human skeletal muscle transcriptome in response to exercise training - part 1	A total of 23 participants (data available in present submission and in GSE58608) completed three months of supervised aerobic exercise training of one leg.

"Understanding the molecular processes underlying intra-tumor heterogeneity is of critical importance to improve the efficiency of therapy and overcome drug resistance. In malignant melanoma, heterogeneity is though to arise -at least partly- through epigenetic rather than genetic reprogramming of proliferating cells, leading to the appearance within the primary tumors of a phenotypically distinct invasive cell subpopulation. The invasive melanoma cells are at the origin of metastatic spread and are thought to provide a reservoir of therapeutically resistant cells. To decipher the gene regulatory networks that underlie the proliferative and invasive cellular states we integrated publicly available gene expression and DNA methylation data from tumor biopsies with a newly generated compendium of open chromatin and histone modification profiling of melanoma cultures that are dominant in either of the two subpopulations. Extensive in silico analyses identified SOX10 and MITF, and AP-1 and TEADs as key upstream regulators of the proliferative and invasive transcriptomes, respectively. Knock-down experiments confirmed the implication of TEADs in the invasive gene network and, more importantly, established a causative link between activation of these transcription factors and melanoma cell invasion and sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60664GSE60833	Dynamics of the human skeletal muscle transcriptome in response to exercise training - part 2	In the present study 23 participants completed three months of supervised aerobic exercise training of one leg (training period 1) followed by 9 months of rest before 12 of the participants completed a second exercise training period (training period 2) of three months of both legs.

EWS-FLI1 leads to changes in gene expression through mechanisms that are not completely understood. We performed RNA sequencing analysis on primary pediatric human mesenchymal progenitor cells (pMPCs) expressing EWS-FLI1 in order to identify novel target genes. This analysis identified lnc277 as a previously uncharacterized long non-coding RNA upregulated by EWS-FLI1 in pMPCs. Inhibiting the expression of lnc277 diminished the ability of Ewing sarcoma cell lines to proliferate and form colonies in soft agar whereas inhibiting lnc277 had no effect on other cell types tested. By analyzing gene expression after shRNA knockdown, we found that both EWS-FLI1 and lnc277 repressed many more genes that they induced and that a significant fraction of EWS-FLI1 repressed targets were also repressed by lnc277. Analysis of primary human Ewing sarcoma RNA sequencing data further supports a role for lnc277 in mediating gene repression. We identified hnRNPK as an RNA binding protein that interacts directly with lnc277. We found a significant overlap in the genes repressed by hnRNPK and those repressed by both EWS-FLI1 and lnc277, suggesting that hnRNPK participates in lnc277 mediated gene repression. Thus, lnc277 is a previously uncharacterized long non-coding RNA downstream of EWS-FLI1 that facilitates the development of Ewing sarcoma via the repression of target genes. Our studies identify a novel mechanism of oncogenesis downstream of a chromosomal translocation and underscore the importance of lncRNA-mediated gene repression as a mechanism of EWS-FLI1 transcriptional regulation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60890GSE60902	Restoration of Progranulin Expression Rescues Cortical Neuron Generation in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Model of Frontotemporal Dementia	"To understand how haploinsufficiency of progranulin (PGRN) protein causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from patients carrying the GRNIVS1+5G>C mutation (FTD-iPSCs). FTD-iPSCs were fated to cortical neurons, the cells most affected in FTD and known to express PGRN. Although generation of neuroprogenitors was unaffected, their further differentiation into neurons, especially CTIP2-, FOXP2- or TBR1-TUJ1 double positive cortical neurons, was significantly decreased in FTD-neural progeny. Zinc finger nuclease-mediated introduction of PGRN cDNA into the AAVS1 locus corrected defects in cortical neurogenesis, demonstrating that PGRN haploinsufficiency causes inefficient cortical neuron generation. RNAseq analysis confirmed reversal of altered gene expression profile following genetic correction. Wnt signaling pathway, one of the top defective pathways in FTD-iPSC-derived neurons coupled with its reversal following genetic correction, makes it an important candidate.

Although patients derive some clinical benefit, treatment resistance inevitably occurs. The MET signaling pathway has been proposed to be a major contributor of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. MET is upregulated in response to VEGF pathway inhibition and plays an essential role in tumorigenesis and progression of tumors. In this study we set out to determine the efficacy of cabozantinib in a preclinical CRC PDTX model. We demonstrate potent inhibitory effects on tumor growth in 80%% of tumors treated. The greatest antitumor effects were observed in tumors that possess a mutation in the PIK3CA gene. The underlying antitumor mechanisms of cabozantinib consisted of inhibition of angiogenesis and Akt activation and significantly decreased expression of genes involved in the PI3K pathway. These findings support further evaluation of cabozantinib in patients with CRC. PIK3CA mutation as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity is intriguing and warrants further elucidation.

Expression analysis revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid beta-oxidaton is up-regulated in naive state while fatty acid synthesis is up-regulated in primed state. Small RNA-seq revealed consistent expression changes in microRNAs that target key fatty acid beta-oxidation and synthesis genes. Integration with metabolomics data revealed consistent changes in the expression of NNMT (higher in naive state) and IDO1 (higher in primed state) and in the concentration of corresponding metabolic substrates and products. As a regulator of S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) level, NNMT is proposed as a candidate regulator of epigenetic states. ChIP-seq analysis releaved that naive lines have lower H3K27me3 marks in developmental genes. Inhibition of STAT3, a known regulator of NNMT, reduces NNMT expression level and decreases overall H3K27me3 marks around transcriptional start sites. In particular, STAT3 inhibitor treatment increased H3K27me3 marks in 313 genes that also have higher H3K27me3 marks in primed state than naive state. These 313 genes are enriched with developmental functions, and include several WNT pathway genes.

Lymphocyte contamination of human airway epithelial samples obtained by bronchoscopy and brushing was excluded by immunohistochemistry staining, the observation of up-regulation of POU2AF1 in purified airway basal stem/progenitor cells undergoing differentiation and analysis of differentiating single basal cell clones. Lentivirus-mediated up-regulation of POU2AF1 in airway basal cells induced up-regulation of host defense genes, including MX1, IFIT3, IFITM and known POU2AF1 downstream genes HLA-DRA, ID2, ID3, IL6, BCL6. Interestingly, expression of these genes paralleled changes of POU2AF1 expression during airway epithelium differentiation in vitro, suggesting POU2AF1 helps to maintain a 'host defense tone' even in pathogen-free condition. Cigarette smoke, a known risk factor for airway infection, suppressed POU2AF1 expression both in vivo in humans and in vitro in human airway epithelial cultures, accompanied by deregulation of POU2AF1 downstream genes. Finally, enhancing POU2AF1 expression in human airway epithelium attenuated the suppression of host defense genes by smoking. Together, these findings suggest a novel function of POU2AF1 as a potential regulator of host defense genes in the human airway epithelium. Methods: Massive parallel RNA sequencing was used to compare the transcriptome of lentivirus mediated POU2AF1 or RFP (control) gene expression in human primary airway epithelial cells (3 samples per group). Uninfected basal cell was used as a further control. Conclusions: The genes up-regulated by POU2AF1 in human airway epithelial cells are mainly related to the intracellular or extracellular anti-pathogen response, suggesting POU2AF1 plays a role in airway epithelial host defense."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60989GSE60996	Generation of a Panel of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells From Chimpanzees: a Resource for Comparative Functional Genomics (RNA-Seq)	"Comparative studies in primates are extremely restricted because we only have access to a few types of cell lines from non-human apes and to a limited collection of frozen tissues. In order to gain better insight into regulatory processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of tissues and cell types. To facilitate this, we have generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from fibroblasts of healthy donors. All lines are free of integration from exogenous reprogramming vectors, can be maintained using standard iPSC culture techniques, and have proliferative and differentiation potential similar to human and mouse lines. To begin demonstrating the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-seq data and methylation profiles from the chimpanzee iPSCs and their corresponding fibroblast precursors, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their precursors, which were of multiple cell type and population origins. Overall, we observed much less regulatory variation within species in the iPSCs than in the somatic precursors, indicating that the reprogramming process has erased many of the differences observed between somatic cells of different origins. We identified 4,918 differentially expressed genes and 1,986 differentially methylated regions between iPSCs of the two species, many of which are novel inter-species differences and not observed between the somatic cells of the two species.

DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are used to treat these disorders, but response is highly variable with few means to predict which patients will benefit. To develop a molecular means of predicting response at diagnosis, we examined baseline differences in mutations, DNA methylation, and gene expression in 40 CMML patients responsive and resistant to decitabine (DAC). While somatic mutations did not differentiate responders and non-responders, we were able to identify for the first time 158 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at baseline between responders and non-responders using next-generation sequencing. These DMRs were primarily localized to non-promoter regions and overlapped with distal regulatory enhancers. Using the methylation profiles, we developed an epigenetic classifier that accurately predicted DAC response at the time of diagnosis. We also found 53 differentially expressed genes between responders and non-responders. Genes up-regulated in responders were enriched in the cell cycle, potentially contributing to effective DAC incorporation. Two chemokines overexpressed in non-responders -- CXCL4 and CXCL7 -- were able to block the effect of DAC on normal CD34+ and primary CMML cells in vitro, suggesting their up-regulation contributes to primary DAC resistance."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61162GSE61255	SMYD2 specificly regulate BIX-01294 induced TP53 target genes revealed by RNA-Seq	We characterized expression profilings of SMYD2 knockdown and control cells treated by BIX-01294 and Rapamycin.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61255GSE61290	Myb-regulated transcriptome in pancreatic cancer	To understand the global view of Myb-regulated genes and pathways in pancreatic cancer.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61290GSE61332	Native Elongating Transcript Sequencing Reveals Human Transcriptional Activity at Nucleotide Resolution	"Major features of transcription by human RNA polymerase II (Pol II) remain poorly defined due to a lack of quantitative approaches for visualizing Pol II progress at nucleotide resolution.We developed a simple and powerful approach for performing native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in human cells that globally maps strand-specific Pol II density at nucleotide resolution. NET-seq exposes a mode of antisense transcription that originates downstream and converges on transcription from the canonical promoter. Convergent transcription is associated with a distinctive chromatin configuration and is characteristic of lower-expressed genes.

As expected, all iPS cells from the patient with Leigh disease were affected. Using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT; Leigh-NT1), we then simultaneously replaced mutated mtDNA and generated pluripotent stem cells from the Leigh patient fibroblasts. In addition to reversing to a normal 8993G>T, oocyte derived donor mtDNA (human haplotype D4a) in Leigh-NT1 differed from the original haplotype (F1a) at a additional 47 nucleotide sites. Leigh-NT1 cells displayed normal metabolic function compared to impaired oxygen consumption and ATP production in Leigh-iPS cells or parental fibroblasts (Leigh-fib). We conclude that natural segregation of heteroplasmic mtDNA allows the generation of iPS cells with exclusively wild type mtDNA. Moreover, SCNT offers mitochondrial gene replacement strategy for patients with homoplasmic mtDNA disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61390GSE61398	Direct identification of endogenous SMG6 targets and a preferred motif spanning SMG6 cleavage sites by parallel analysis of RNA ends in human cells	"In metazoans, the endoribonuclease SMG6 is thought to cleave many endogenous mRNAs targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). However, most evidence as to the identity of endogenous SMG6 substrates is indirect, and little is known about their cleavage sites. Here, we report the efficacy of an RNA degradome approach called parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) for identifying NMD intermediates in human cells. By specifically sequencing the 5 ends of intermediates dependent on SMG6 and the critical NMD factor UPF1, hundreds of endogenous transcripts that are direct targets of SMG6 have been revealed. A preferred sequence motif spanning most SMG6 cleavage sites has been identified and validated by mutational analysis. For many SMG6 substrates, depletion of SMG6 leads to decapping of the RNAs. These findings provide key insights into NMD and targeting by SMG6 while also demonstrating the potential of PARE for analyzing other ribonucleases with diverse endogenous substrates."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61398GSE61474	Quantitative profiling of long noncoding RNAs with targeted RNA sequencing.	"We compared the performance of conventional RNAseq with RNA Capture Sequencing (CaptureSeq) to assemble and quantify known RNA spike-Ins and human transcripts. We find CaptureSeq to be superior for the detection and quantification of the 37%% lowest expressed genes, and comparable for the next 45%% of moderately expressed genes. CaptureSeq contributes only minor technical variation and measures differential gene expression accurately. We demonstrate these advantages by the targeted sequencing of long noncoding RNAs across 20 human tissues, expanding previous annotations two-fold and simultaneously generating a quantitative atlas of expression. This analysis confirms the use of CaptureSeq as an important method for transcriptional profiling."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61474GSE61476	FOXG1-dependent dysregulation of GABA/glutamate neuron differentiation in autism spectrum disorders	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disorder of brain development believed, in most cases, to be of genetic origin.

We explored the transcriptional networks that CHD8 regulates in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by reducing its expression and then integrating transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) with genome-wide CHD8 binding (ChIP-seq). Suppressing CHD8 to levels comparable with loss of a single allele caused altered expression of 1,756 genes, 64.9%% of which were up-regulated. CHD8 showed widespread binding to chromatin, with 7,324 replicated sites that marked 5,658 genes. Integration of these data suggests that a limited array of direct regulatory effects of CHD8 produced a much larger network of secondary expression changes. Genes indirectly down-regulated (i.e., without CHD8 binding sites) reflect pathways involved in brain development, including synapse formation, neuron differentiation, cell adhesion, and axon guidance, whereas CHD8-bound genes are strongly associated with chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. Genes associated with ASD were strongly enriched among indirectly down-regulated loci (p=1.01x10-9) and CHD8-bound genes (p = 4.34x10-3), which align with previously identified co-expression modules during fetal development. We also find an intriguing enrichment of cancer related gene-sets among CHD8-bound genes (p < 1.9x10-11). In vivo suppression of chd8 in zebrafish produced macrocephaly comparable to that of humans with inactivating mutations. These data indicate that heterozygous disruption of CHD8 precipitates a network of gene expression changes involved in neurodevelopmental pathways in which many ASD-associated genes may converge on shared mechanisms of pathogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61491GSE61544	Low MITF/AXL ratio predicts early resistance to multiple targeted drugs in melanoma	"Increased MITF expression contributes to melanoma progression and resistance to BRAF pathway inhibition. We show that, unexpectedly, lack of MITF is associated with more severe resistance to a range of inhibitors. Indeed, the presence of endogenous MITF was essential for robust drug responses. Both in primary and acquired resistance, MITF levels inversely correlated with expression of several activated receptor tyrosine kinases, most commonly AXL. The MITF-low/AXL-high/drug resistance phenotype was seen in roughly half of BRAF mutant and the majority of NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines. The dichotomous behavior of MITF in drug response was corroborated in vemurafenib-resistant biopsies, including MITF high and low clones in a relapsed patient. Drug cocktails containing AXL inhibitor enhanced melanoma cell elimination by BRAF or ERK inhibition. Our results demonstrate that a low MITF/AXL ratio predicts early resistance to multiple targeted drugs, and warrant clinical validation of AXL inhibitors to combat resistance of BRAF and NRAS mutant MITF-low melanomas."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61544GSE61549	A long non-coding RNA tunes PRC1 function during human and zebrafish development	"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as functional regulators of gene expression in many species1,2. However, aligning lncRNA-dependent phenotypes with their underlying molecular mechanisms remains challenging. The Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) family of the Polycomb Group (PcG) complexes interacts with lncRNAs and is essential for gene silencing during development. Despite the functional importance of PRC1, few specific lncRNAs that guide PRC1 activity are known3-5. We screened for human RNAs which co-precipitate with the PRC1-component BMI1, from a chromatin fraction. Knockdown of several of the lncRNA candidates perturbed PcG-regulated gene expression in vivo. In particular, we found that the PRC1-associated lncRNA CAT7 tunes PRC1 function during zebrafish and human development. During neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells, CAT7 impacts expression and PcG-binding of the MNX1 locus, which encodes a master regulator of motor neuron development. During zebrafish development, human CAT7 functionally rescues defects caused by interference of the non-syntenic analog, zebrafish cat7 (zcat7.) Further, zcat7 genetically interacts with bmi1a/b during zebrafish embryogenesis. We propose that PRC1 acts in concert with specific lncRNAs, and that CAT7/zcat7 represent lncRNAs that convergently evolved to tune PRC1 repression at individual loci. We immunoprecipitated PRC1-interacting RNAs from a chromatin fraction using a technology called GRIP. We identified candidates in HeLa cells containing a 25%% overexpression of FLAG-tagged murine Bmi1 (ectopic). Candidates were selected which were enriched in both Bmi1 and FLAG-Bmi1 GRIP versus input. Knockdown of 17 of these candidates was performed (vs a scramble control) and total RNA was sequenced 48 hours after knockdown. One candidate, CAT7 was also knocked down in developing (motor) neural cells (grown from human embryonic stem cells). We also performed ChIP targeting Polycomb proteins in the HeLa cells depleted for CAT7 or scramble controls."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61549GSE61566	Isolation and Transcriptome Analyses of Human Erythroid Progenitors: BFU-E and CFU-E	"Burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cells are erythroid progenitors traditionally defined by colony assays. We developed a flow cytometry-based strategy for isolating human BFU-E and CFU-E cells based on the changes in expression of cell surface markers during in vitro erythroid cell culture. BFU-E and CFU-E are characterized by CD45+GPA-IL-3R-CD34+CD36-CD71low and CD45+GPA-IL-3R-CD34-CD36+CD71high phenotypes, respectively. Colony assays validated phenotypic assignment giving rise to BFU-E and CFU-E colonies, both at a purity ~90%%. The BFU-E colony forming ability of CD45+GPA-IL-3R-CD34+CD36-CD71low cells required SCF and erythropoietin, while the CFU-E colony forming ability of CD45+GPA-IL-3R-CD34-CD36+CD71high cells required only erythropoietin. Bioinformatic analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed unique transcriptomes in each differentiation stage. The sorting strategy was validated in uncultured primary cells isolated from bone marrow and peripheral blood, indicating that marker expression is not an artifact of in vitro cell culture, but represents an in vivo characteristic of erythroid progenitor populations. The ability to isolate highly pure human BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors will enable detailed cellular and molecular characterization of these distinct progenitor populations and define their contribution to disordered erythropoiesis in inherited and acquired hematological disease. Our data provide important resource for future studies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61566GSE61586	The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression	"Recent studies have identified a Lys 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutation at one allele ofH3F3A, one of the two genes encoding histone H3 variant H3.3, in 60%% of high-grade pediatric glioma cases. The median survival of this group of patients after diagnosis is 1 yr. Here we show that the levels of H3K27 di- and trimethylation (H3K27me2 and H3K27me3) are reduced globally in H3.3K27M patient samples due to the expression of the H3.3K27M mutant allele. Remarkably, we also observed that H3K27me3 and Ezh2 (the catalytic subunit of H3K27 methyltransferase) at chromatin are dramatically increased locally at hundreds of gene loci in H3.3K27M patient cells. Moreover, the gain of H3K27me3 and Ezh2 at gene promoters alters the expression of genes that are associated with various cancer pathways. These results indicate that H3.3K27M mutation reprograms epigenetic landscape and gene expression, which may drive tumorigenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61586GSE61600	Comparison of human PRDM12 mutants D31Y and E172D with wildtype fibroblasts	Fibroblasts from PRDM12 patients and unaffected wildtype relatives were cultured until near confluency.

Here we compared the genetic and epigenetic stability of human nuclear-transfer embryonic stem cell (NT-ESC) lines and isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, derived from the same somatic cell cultures of fetal, neonatal and adult origin. Both cell types shared similar genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles. Importantly, NT-ESCs and iPSCs have comparable numbers of de novo coding mutations but significantly higher than parthenogenetic ESCs. Similar to iPSCs NT-ESCs displayed clone- and gene-specific aberrations in DNA methylation and allele-specific expression of imprinted genes, similarly to iPSCs. The occurrence of these genetic and epigenetic defects in both NT-ESCs and iPSCs suggests that they are inherent to reprogramming, regardless of the underlying technique."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61656GSE61674	In vitro differentiation of human low threshold mechanoreceptive (LTMR) neurons from embryonic stem cells	Human embryonic stem cells were differentiated into peripheral sensory neurons via the intermediate generation of neural crest like cell (NCC).

To uncover new synthetic lethalities with known breast cancer oncogenes, we screened an epigenome-focused short hairpin RNA library on a panel of engineered breast epithelial cell lines. Here we report a selective interaction between the NOTCH1 signaling pathway and the SUMOylation cascade. Knockdown of the E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (UBE2I) as well as inhibition of the E1-activating complex SAE1/UBA2 using ginkgolic acid impairs the growth of NOTCH1-activated breast epithelial cells. We show that upon inhibition of SUMOylation NOTCH1-activated cells proceed slower through the cell cycle and ultimately enter apoptosis. Mechanistically, activation of NOTCH1 signaling depletes the pool of unconjugated small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) and SUMO2/3 leading to increased sensitivity to perturbation of the SUMOylation cascade. Depletion of unconjugated SUMO correlates with sensitivity to inhibition of SUMOylation also in patient-derived breast cancer cell lines with constitutive NOTCH pathway activation. Our investigation suggests that SUMOylation cascade inhibitors should be further explored as targeted treatment for NOTCH-driven breast cancer."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61727GSE61742	Impact of regulatory variation from RNA to protein	"Genetic variants that impact gene regulation are important contributors to human phenotypic variation. For this reason, considerable efforts have been made to identify genetic associations with differences in mRNA levels of nearby genes, namely, cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The phenotypic consequences of eQTLs are presumably due, in most cases, to their ultimate effects on protein expression levels. Yet, only few studies have quantified the impact of genetic variation on proteins levels directly. It remains unclear how faithfully eQTLs are reflected at the protein level, and whether there is a significant layer of cis regulatory variation acting primarily on translation or steady state protein levels. To address these questions, we measured ribosome occupancy by high-throughput sequencing, and relative protein levels by high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, in a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in which we had previously measured transcript expression using RNA sequencing. We then mapped genetic variants that are associated with changes in transcript expression (eQTLs), ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). Most of the QTLs we detected are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, we found that eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, suggesting that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of a class of cis QTLs that specifically affect protein abundance with little or no effect on mRNA levels; most of these QTLs have little effect on ribosome occupancy, and hence may arise from differences in post-translational regulation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61742GSE61794	PTEN suppresses neoplastic transformation of human neural stem cells by transcriptional repression of Pax7	"Our data throw light upon the effect of PTEN deficiency on gene expression, epigenomic modifications(H3K4me3, H3K27me3, 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-methylcytosin)."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61794GSE61844	Genome-wide detection of DNase I hypersensitive sites in single cells and FFPE tissue samples	"DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) provide important information on the presence of transcriptional regulatory elements and the state of chromatin in mammalian cells1, 2, 3. Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells4, 5. Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G>C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion, scDNase-seq can reliably detect DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range of applications of DHS analysis both for basic and for translational research, and may provide critical information for personalized medicine."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61844GSE61950	Genome-wide chromatin analysis of Ewing sarcoma (RNA-seq)	"We show that EWS-FLI1, an aberrant transcription factor responsible for the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma, reprograms gene regulatory circuits by directly inducing or directly repressing enhancers.

BRG1 is essential for melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and for normal melanocyte development in vivo. MITF and SOX10 actively recruit BRG1 to a set of MITF-associated regulatory elements (MAREs) at active enhancers. MITF, SOX10 and YY1 bind between two BRG1-occupied nucleosomes thus defining both a combinatorial signature of transcription factors essential for the melanocyte lineage and a specific chromatin organisation of MAREs.

Autophagy, a highly conserved cellular self-degradative process, is a key player in the initiation and maintenance of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). However, the regulatory circuits that activate autophagy, and how they enable reprogramming of PDA cell metabolism are unknown. We now show that autophagy regulation in PDA occurs as part of a broader program that coordinates activation of lysosome biogenesis, function and nutrient scavenging, through constitutive activation of the MiT/TFE family of bHLH transcription factors. In PDA cells, the MiT/TFE proteins - MITF, TFE3 and TFEB - override a regulatory mechanism that controls their nuclear translocation, resulting in their constitutive activation. By orchestrating the expression of a coherent network of genes that induce high levels of lysosomal catabolic function, the MiT/TFE factors are required for proliferation and tumorigenicity of PDA cells. Importantly, unbiased global metabolite profiling reveals that MiT/TFE-dependent autophagy-lysosomal activation is specifically required to maintain intracellular AA pools in PDA. This AA flux is part of a program that is essential for metabolic homeostasis and bioenergetics of PDA but not for their non-transformed counterparts. These results identify the MiT/TFE transcription factors as master regulators of the autophagy-lysosomal system in PDA and demonstrate a central role of the autophagosome-lysosome compartment in maintaining tumor cell metabolism through alternative amino acid acquisition and utilization."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62077GSE62093	Human ovarian granulosa cell transcriptome	We used mRNA-seq to profile transcriptomes of purified human ovarian granulosa cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62093GSE62098	RNA-Seq of the corpus callosum from 12 individuals	"We performed RNA-Seq for the corpus callosum sampled from 12 individuals.

Paused Pol II release is thought to require the kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) for the phosphorylation of DRB sensitivity-inducing factor, negative elongation factor, and C-terminal domain (CTD) serine-2 of Pol II. We found that Pol II-associated factor 1 (PAF1) is a critical regulator of paused Pol II release, that positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) directly regulates the initial recruitment of PAF1 complex (PAF1C) to genes, and that the subsequent recruitment of CDK12 is dependent on PAF1C. These findings reveal cooperativity among P-TEFb, PAF1C, and CDK12 in pausing release and Pol II CTD phosphorylation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62171GSE62190	Leucegene: AML sequencing (part 3)	RNA sequencing of human leukemia	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62190GSE62193	Dissecting neural differentiation regulatory networks through epigenetic footprinting	"Human pluripotent stem cell derived models that accurately recapitulate neural development in vitro and allow for the generation of specific neuronal subtypes are of major interest to the stem cell and biomedical community. Notch signaling, particularly through the Notch effector HES5, is a major pathway critical for the onset and maintenance of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the embryonic and adult nervous system1-3. Use of a HES5 reporter enables the isolation distinct populations of human embryonic stem (ES) cell derived NPCs that represent building blocks of cortical development in vitro4. Here, we report the transcriptional and epigenomic analysis of six consecutive stages of human ES cell differentiation along the neural lineage aimed at modeling key cell fate decisions including specification, expansion and patterning during the ontogeny of neural stem and progenitor cells. In order to dissect the regulatory mechanisms that orchestrate the stage-specific differentiation process we developed a computational framework to infer key regulators of each cell state transition based on the progressive remodeling of the epigenetic landscape and then validated these through a pooled shRNA screen. We were also able to refine our previous observations on epigenetic priming at transcription factor binding sites and show here that they are mediated by combinations of core and stage-specific factors. Taken together, we demonstrate the utility of our reference maps and outline a general framework, not limited to the context of the neural lineage, to dissect regulatory circuits of differentiation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62193GSE62207	Ileal immune maturation in Pediatric Crohn's Disease	We report the global pattern of ileal gene expression in a cohort of 310 treatment-nave pediatric Crohn Disease patients and controls.

"Kruppel-like factor-9 (KLF9), a member of the large KLF transcription factor family, has emerged as a regulator of oncogenesis, cell differentiation and neural development; however, the molecular basis for KLF9s diverse contextual functions remains unclear. This study focuses on the functions of KLF9 in human glioblastoma stem-like cells. We establish for the first time a genome-wide map of KLF9-regulated targets in human glioblastoma stem-like cells, and show that KLF9 functions as a transcriptional repressor and thereby regulates multiple signaling pathways involved in oncogenesis and stem cell regulation. A detailed analysis of one such pathway, integrin signaling, shows that the capacity of KLF9 to inhibit glioblastoma cell stemness and tumorigenicity requires ITGA6 repression. These findings enhance our understanding of the transcriptional networks underlying cancer cell stemness and differentiation, and identify KLF9-regulated molecular targets applicable to cancer therapeutics."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62212GSE62228	Interphase condensins regulate ligand-depedent enhancer activation (GRO-seq)	"An emerging theme of gene regulation is the involvement of architectural chromosomal molecules in transcription control. Condensins are critical regulators of mitotic chromosomes, but their interphase chromatin localization and functions remain poorly understood. Here we report that both the condensin I and condensin II complexes exhibit an unexpected, dramatic 17-?-estradiol-induced preferential recruitment to oestrogen receptor ? (ER-?)-bound active enhancers in interphase breast cancer cells, exhibiting non-canonical interaction with ER-? distinct from classic cofactors. Condensins prove to positively regulate ligand-dependent gene and eRNA transcription by modulating a binding equilibrium of enhancer-associated coactivators/corepressors, including p300 and RIP140. This activity was achieved by the condensin-dependent recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, HECTD1, to active enhancers, where it polyubiquitinates and dismisses corepressor RIP140 to stimulate eRNA transcription. Collectively, our results reveal an important, unanticipated transcriptional role of interphase condensins in modulating enhancer activation, providing new insights into enhancer function in the regulated transcriptional programs"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62228GSE62241	Enhancer Sequence Variants and Transcription Factor Deregulation Synergize to Construct Pathogenic Regulatory Circuits in B Cell Lymphoma (RNA-Seq)	"Most B cell lymphomas arise in the germinal center (GC), where humoral immune responses evolve from potentially oncogenic cycles of mutation, proliferation, and clonal selection. Although lymphoma gene expression diverges significantly from GC-B cells, underlying mechanisms that alter the activities of corresponding regulatory elements (REs) remain elusive. Here we define the complete pathogenic circuitry of human follicular lymphoma (FL), which activates or decommissions transcriptional circuits from normal GC-B cells and commandeers enhancers from other lineages. Moreover, independent sets of transcription factors, whose expression is deregulated in FL, target commandeered versus decommissioned REs. Our approach reveals two distinct subtypes of low-grade FL, whose pathogenic circuitries resemble GC-B or activated B cells. Remarkably, FL-altered enhancers also are enriched for sequence variants, including somatic mutations, which disrupt transcription factor binding and expression of circuit-linked genes. Thus, the pathogenic regulatory circuitry of FL reveals distinct genetic and epigenetic etiologies for GC-B transformation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62241GSE62247	Cell fate determination by ubiquitin-dependent regulation of translation	"Metazoan development depends on accurate execution of differentiation programs that allow pluripotent stem cells to adopt specific fates. Differentiation is brought about by global changes to chromatin architecture and transcriptional networks, yet whether other regulatory events support cell fate determination is less well understood. Using human embryonic stem cell and Xenopus models, we identified the vertebrate-specific ubiquitin ligase Cul3KBTBD8 as an essential regulator of neural crest specification. Cul3KBTBD8 monoubiquitylates NOLC1 and its paralog TCOF1, whose mutation underlies the craniofacial disorder Treacher Collins Syndrome that is characterized by a loss of cranial neural crest cells. Ubiquitylation of NOLC1 and TCOF1 drives formation of a platform that connects RNA polymerase I with ribosome modification enzymes, thereby altering the translational program of differentiating cells to support the generation of neural crest cells. We conclude that the dynamic regulation of ribosome function is an important feature of cell fate determination."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62247GSE62276	Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation at single-base resolution based on MeDIP-bisulfite high-throughput sequencing and ridge regression (RNA)	"Unraveling complexity of DNA methylome is essential to decipher DNA methylation mechanism in life. However, this has been subjected to technological constraints to balance between cost and accurate measurement of the DNA methylation level. In this study, by innovatively introducing C-hydroxylmethylated adapters, we have developed MeDIP-Bisulfite sequencing (MB-seq), which could obtain DNA methylome of repertoire CpGs at single-base resolution. We found MB-seq only costs 10%% of MethylC-seq, but covers 85%% of total CpGs in human genome. Unlike absolute methylation levels determined by MethylC-seq and RRBS, MB-seq presented relative methylation levels that are linearly inflated. This has enlightened us to develop a MB-seq corresponding correction method for methylation level based on ridge regression, which integrates the data of MB-seq and RRBS to predict the methylation level of total 28.2 million CpGs on human genome with high accuracy (Pearson correlation coefficient, PCC=0.90). Moreover, by employing MB-seq, we generated the DNA methylome of an ovarian epithelial cell line (T29) and its oncogenic counterpart (T29H), respectively. After ridge regression, we identified 131,790 differential methylation regions (DMRs) with high accuracy between T29 and T29H, far more than 7,567 obtained from RRBS. Taken together, our result demonstrated that the MB-seq combined with ridge regression is a wide applicable approach for profiling of DNA methylome."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62276GSE62288	A Novel Population of Human Cardiac Resident Mesenchymal Stem Cells	"We describe a novel population of human adult cardiac resident stem cells (CRSCs), which are positive for W8B2 antigen, originating from human adult atrial appendages.

In particular, more than 90%% of the risk variants lie in non-coding regions, and almost 10%% of these map to long non-coding RNA transcripts (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are known to show more cell-type specificity than protein-coding genes. Methods: In this study, we aimed to characterize lncRNAs and protein-coding genes located in loci associated with nine AID which have been well-defined by Immunochip analysis, by transcriptome analysis across seven peripheral blood leukocyte populations (granulocytes, monocytes, NK cells, B-cells, memory-T cells, naive CD4+ and naive CD8+ T-cells) and four cord blood derived T-helper cell populations (precursor, primary, polarized (Th1, Th2) T-helper cells). Results: We show that lncRNAs mapping to loci shared between AIDs are significantly enriched in immune cell types when compared to lncRNAs from the whole genome (<0.005). We were not able to prioritize single cell types relevant for specific diseases, but we observed five cell types enriched (<0.005) in five AID (NK cells for inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis; memory-T and CD8+ T-cells in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis; Th0 and Th2 cells for inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis). Furthermore we show that co-expression analyses of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes can predict the signaling pathways in which these AID-associated lncRNAs are involved. Conclusions: The observed enrichment of lncRNA transcripts in AID loci implies an important role for lncRNAs in AID etiology and suggests that lncRNA genes should be studied in more detail to correctly interpret GWAS findings. The co-expression results strongly support a model in which the lncRNA and protein-coding genes function together in the same pathways."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62408GSE62448	Enhanced MyoD-Induced Transdifferentiation to a Myogenic Lineage by Fusion to a Potent Transactivation Domain	"Synthetic transcription factors can be applied to many areas of biotechnology, medicine, and basic research. Currently, the most common method for engineering synthetic transcription factors has been based on programmable DNA-binding domains of zinc finger proteins, Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs), and most recently the CRISPR/Cas9 system. These transcription factor platforms consist of the DNA-binding domain fused to potent transcriptional activation domains, most commonly the tetramer of the minimal transactivation domain of the VP16 protein from herpes simplex virus, referred to as VP64. Although many applications are well-suited for the targeted activation of a single gene, genetic reprogramming requires the coordinated regulation of many nodes of natural gene networks as is typically performed by naturally occurring reprogramming factors. Thus we sought to combine principles from each of these approaches by attaching potent transcriptional activation domains to a natural reprogramming factor to increase the efficiency and/or rate of cell fate conversion. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fusing potent activation domains to the transcription factor MyoD, the master regulator of the skeletal myoblast lineage. In certain non-myogenic lineages, MyoD overexpression causes upregulation of the myogenic gene network and conversion to a myoblast phenotype including cell fusion into multinucleated myotubes. Compared to wild-type MyoD, the VP64-MyoD fusion protein induced greater overall reprogramming of global gene expression. This simple approach for increasing the potency of natural reprogramming factors circumvents the need for screening engineered proteins and leads to a more robust cellular reprogramming compared to treatment with the wild type transcription factor."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62448GSE62483	T-bet recruits P-TEFb to super-enhancers to regulate T helper cell differentiation (RNA-Seq)	"The transcription factor T-bet induces differentiation of CD4+ T cells into the Th1 lineage and also allows for a degree of functional plasticity. Here, we show that T-bet acts through super-enhancers to recruit the elongation factor P-TEFb. Th1-specific genes are poised for activation in Th2 cells and P-TEFb recruitment activates transcriptional elongation. T-bet also induces extensive P-TEFb binding at super-enhancers, where it acts to stimulate enhancer RNA transcription. P-TEFb inhibition selectively blocks activation of lineage-specific genes and reverses Th1-associated retinitis pathology. T-bet-mediated recruitment of P-TEFb to super-enhancers at otherwise poised genes provides a model for how lineage-specifying factors promote differentiation towards specific cell fates whilst maintaining a degree of functional plasticity."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62483GSE62518	IL-33 activates tumor stroma to promote intestinal polyposis	"Tumor epithelial cells develop within a microenvironment consisting of extracellular matrix, growth factors, and cytokines produced by non-epithelial stromal cells. In response to paracrine signals from tumor epithelia, stromal cells modify the microenvironment to promote tumor growth and metastasis. Here, we identify interleukin (IL)-33 as an epithelial cell-derived regulator of stromal cell activation and mediator of intestinal polyposis. IL-33 expression was elevated in the tumors and serum of colorectal cancer patients and induced in the adenomatous polyps of ApcMin/+ mutant mice. Genetic and antibody suppression of IL-33 signaling in ApcMin/+ mice inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed angiogenesis in polyps, which reduced both tumor number and size. In ApcMin/+ polyps, IL-33 expression localized to tumor epithelial cells and expression of the IL-33 receptor, IL1RL1, associated with two stromal cell types, namely subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs) and mast cells, whose activation was previously associated with polyposis. In vitro IL-33 stimulation of human SEMFs induced the expression of extracellular matrix components and growth factors associated with intestinal tumor progression. IL-33 deficiency reduced mast cell accumulation in ApcMin/+ polyps and expression of mast cell-derived proteases and cytokines known to promote polyposis. Together, our results suggest that IL-33 is a tumor epithelial cell-derived paracrine signal that promotes polyposis through the coordinated activation of stromal cells and the formation of a reactive stroma microenvironment."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62518GSE62520	RNA-sequencing of mRNAs from control and CAP-D3 deficient Salmonella infected HT-29 cells	"BACKGROUND & AIMS- More frequent interaction of bacteria with the colonic epithelium is associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). The identities of all proteins which promote bacterial clearance in colonic epithelial cells are unknown. Previously, we discovered that dCAP-D3 (Chromosome Associated Protein-D3), regulates responses to bacterial infection. We examined whether CAP-D3 promotes bacterial clearance in human colonic epithelium. METHODS- Clearance of Salmonella or adherent-invasive Escherichia coli LF82 was assessed by gentamycin protection assays in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells expressing CAP-D3 shRNA. CAP-D3 levels in colonic epithelial cells from healthy and UC patient tissues were analyzed by immunoblot. RNA-sequencing identified bacterially-induced CAP-D3 target genes. The role of CAP-D3 target genes in bacterial clearance was analyzed by gentamycin protection assays, immunofluorescent staining, and by using pharmacologic inhibitors. RESULTS- CAP-D3 expression was reduced in colonic epithelial cells from UC patients with active disease. Reduction of CAP-D3 expression inhibited autophagy and decreased intracellular bacterial clearance. The components of the heterodimeric SLC7A5/SLC3A2 amino acid transporter were identified as CAP-D3 target genes; their levels increased in infected, CAP-D3 deficient cell lines and in cells from UC patients. In HT-29 cells, this resulted in earlier SLC7A5 recruitment to Salmonella-containing vacuoles, increased mTOR activity, and enhanced bacterial survival. Inhibition of SLC7A5/SLC3A2 or mTOR activity rescued the bacterial clearance defect in CAP-D3 deficient cells. CONCLUSIONS- CAP-D3 attenuates amino acid transporter transcription to promote bacterial autophagy in colon epithelial cells. CAP-D3 protein levels are decreased in patients with active UC, suggesting that CAP-D3 is a potential therapeutic target to restore mucosal homeostasis in UC patients."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62520GSE62526	Gene expression profiling of melanoma cell lines by high throughput sequencing	A panel of 29 melanoma cell lines were gene expression profiled by RNA-Seq.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62526GSE62540	SMN2 splicing modifiers improve motor function and longevity in mice with spinal muscular atrophy	Characterization of the selectivity of SMN splicing modifiers in SMA type I fibroblasts by RNASeq	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62540GSE62544	Profiling of three leiomyosarcoma molecular subtypes with RNA-sequencing	"Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant neoplasm with smooth muscle differentiation, and there are three molecular subtypes of LMS which have been defined previously by our lab.

We report here that the histone methyltransferase NSD2 drives cancer cell and tumor resistance to therapeutics such as tamoxifen, doxorubicin, and radiation by reprogramming of glucose metabolism. NSD2 coordinately up-regulates expression of TIGAR, HK2 and G6PD and stimulates pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) production of NADPH for ROS reduction. We discover that elevated expression of TIGAR, previously characterized as a fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, is localized in the nuclei of resistant tumor cells where it stimulates NSD2 expression and global H3K36me2 mark. Mechanistically, TIGAR interacts with the antioxidant regulator Nrf2 and facilitates chromatin assembly of Nrf2-H3K4me3 methylase MLL1 and elongating Pol-II, independent of its metabolic enzymatic activity. In human tumors, high levels of NSD2 correlate strongly with early recurrence and poor survival and are associated with nuclear-localized TIGAR.

"Mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor forkhead box P1 or FOXP1 occur in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.

Here, we identify the gene expression program regulated by FoxP1 in both human neural cells and mouse brain and demonstrate a conserved role for FOXP1 transcriptional regulation of autism and Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) mediated pathways. Coexpression networks support a role for Foxp1 in neuronal activity, and we show that Foxp1 is necessary for neuronal excitability. Using a Foxp1 mouse model, we observe defects in ultrasonic vocalizations. This behavioral phenotype is reflected at the genomic level as striatal Foxp1-regulated overlap with genes known to be important in rodent vocalizations.

However, to identify such therapies it is essential to determine the genomic and transcriptional alterations present in one tumor relative to control samples. This presents a challenge since use of a single sample precludes many standard statistical analysis techniques. We reasoned that one means of addressing this issue is by comparing transcriptional changes in one tumor with those observed in a large cohort of patients analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To test this directly, we devised a bioinformatics pipeline to identify differentially expressed genes in tumors resected from patients suffering from the most common malignant adult brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM). We performed RNA sequencing on tumors from individual GBM patients and filtered the results through the TCGA database in order to identify possible gene networks that are overrepresented in GBM samples relative to controls. Importantly, we demonstrate that hypergeometric-based analysis of gene pairs identifies gene networks that validate experimentally.

Here we constructed and characterized a clonal, inducible human reprogramming system that provides a reliable source of cells at any stage of the process. This system enabled integrative transcriptional and epigenomic analysis across the human reprogramming timeline at high resolution. We observed distinct waves of gene network activation, including the ordered re-activation of broad developmental regulators followed by early embryonic patterning genes and culminating in the emergence of a signature reminiscent of pre-implantation stages. Moreover, complementary functional analyses allowed us to identify and validate novel regulators of the reprogramming process.

Purpose: Kaposis sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes several lymphoproliferative disorders, including KS, a common AIDS-associated malignancy. Cellular and viral microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in regulating the expression of genes in oncogenesis. Herpesviruses, including KSHV, encode for miRNAs that are involved in angiogenesis, inflammation and apoptosis. A better knowledge of the miRNA-mediated pathways that regulate KSHV infection is therefore essential for an improved understanding of viral infection and pathogenesis. Methods: In this study, we used deep sequencing to analyze miRNA, both viral and human, and mRNA expression in KS tumor-derived human cells. Results: This approach revealed 153 differentially expressed human miRNAs between KSHV-positive and -negative cells. Differential expression of eight miRNAs was independently confirmed by qRT-PCR. We additionally showed that a majority (~73%%) of KSHV-regulated miRNAs are down-regulated, including most members of the 14q32 miRNA cluster. Specifically, human miR-409-3p, which is known to target the pro-angiogenic growth factor angiogenin and the inflammation marker fibrinogen-beta, was significantly down-regulated in KSHV-infected cells based on deep sequencing and qRT-PCR. Despite this substantial down-regulation of cellular miRNAs, hsa-miR-708-5p was significantly up-regulated by KSHV and has been shown to directly inhibit pro-apoptotic protease Caspase-2. Finally, we evaluated to what extent there was an inverse correlation between miRNA and mRNA expression levels. Using filtered datasets, we identified relevant canonical pathways that were significantly enriched. Conclusion: Taken together, our data demonstrate that most human miRNAs affected by KSHV are repressed and our findings highlight the relevance of studying the post-transcriptional gene regulation of miRNAs for KSHV-associated malignancies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62829GSE62852	LncRNAs specific signature in acute myeloid leukemia with intermediate risk	"The aim of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia with normal cytogenetics (NC-AML).

Circadian oscillations are predicated on transcriptional-translational feedback loops, which balance the activities of the transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1 and repressors encoded by PER and CRY genes. Here we show that loss of PER2 expression silences circadian oscillations in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). Downregulation was preceded by reduced CLOCK binding to a noncanonical E-box enhancer in the PER2 promoter and occurred between 12 - 24 h after exposure to a deciduogenic stimulus. RNA sequencing revealed that premature inhibition of PER2 by siRNA knockdown leads to a grossly disorganised decidual response. Gene ontology analysis highlighted a preponderance of cell cycle regulators amongst the 1,121 genes perturbed upon PER2 knockdown. Congruently, PER2 inhibition abrogated mitotic expansion of differentiating HESCs by inducing cell cycle block at G2/M. Analysis of mid-luteal endometrial biopsies revealed an inverse correlation between PER2 transcript levels and the number of miscarriages in women suffering reproductive failure. Thus, PER2 synchronizes mitotic expansion of HESCs with a periodic decidual gene expression; uncoupling of these events may cause persistent pregnancy failure."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62854GSE62889	Genome-wide expression profile of the Tet-On HCT116 inducible cell line that express either the human HNF42 or HNF48 under control of Doxycycline (DOX) [RNAseq]	"Purpose: Aim of the study is to identify functional differences between the P1 and P2-HNF4 isoforms. To do this, we generated Tet-On inducible lines that express either the human (P1) HNF42 or (P2) HNF48 under control of DOX in the HCT116 human colon cancer cells. Methods: HNF42 and Parental lines were induced with 0.3 g/mL DOX, while HNF48 line was induced with either 0.1 or 0.3 g/mL DOX for 24 hours. Samples were generated by deep sequencing, using the Illumina TruSeq RNA. Result: There were common and unique dysregulated genes identified in the HNF42 and HNF48 lines (+DOX); more upregulated genes than downregulated genes in both the lines. Conclusion: The functional difference between HNF42 and HNF48 is that the latter tends to upregulate genes involved in proliferation and anti-apoptosis while HNF42 upregulates genes involved in growth suppression and cell death."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62889GSE62907	The inactive X chromosome is epigenetically unstable and transcriptionally labile in breast cancer	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62907GSE62913	Genome wide transcript and miRNAanalysis of invitro and in-vivo generated human cardiac samples	We report the identification of miRNAs and transcripts that are regulated during human cardiac maturation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62913GSE62920	The Activation-Induced Assembly of an RNA/Protein Interactome Centered on the Splicing Factor U2AF2 Regulates Gene Expression in Human CD4 T Cells [RNA-seq]	"Activation of CD4 T cells is a reaction to challenges such as microbial pathogens, cancer and toxins that defines adaptive immune responses. The roles of T cell receptor crosslinking, intracellular signaling, and transcription factor activation are well described, but the importance of post-transcriptional regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) has not been considered in depth. We describe a new model expanding and activating primary human CD4 T cells and applied this to characterizing activation-induced assembly of splicing factors centered on U2AF2. We immunoprecipitated U2AF2 to identify what mRNA transcripts were bound as a function of activation by TCR crosslinking and costimulation. In parallel, mass spectrometry revealed the proteins incorporated into the U2AF2-centered RNA/protein interactome. Molecules that retained interaction with the U2AF2 complex after RNAse treatment were designated as central interactome members (CIMs). Mass spectrometry also identified a second class of activation-induced proteins, peripheral interactome members (PIMs), that bound to the same transcripts but were not in physical association with U2AF2 or its partners. siRNA knockdown of two CIMs and two PIMs caused changes in activation marker expression, cytokine secretion, and gene expression that were unique to each protein and mapped to pathways associated with key aspects of T cell activation. While knocking down the PIM, SYNCRIP, impacts a limited but immunologically important set of U2AF2-bound transcripts, knockdown of U2AF1 significantly impairs assembly of the majority of protein and mRNA components in the activation-induced interactome. These results demonstrated that CIMs and PIMs, either directly or indirectly through RNA, assembled into activation-induced U2AF2 complexes and play roles in post-transcriptional regulation of genes related to cytokine secretion. These data suggest an additional layer of regulation mediated by the activation-induced assembly of RNA splicing interactomes that is important for understanding T cell activation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62920GSE62930	Human cells contain natural double-stranded RNAs with potential regulatory capacity	"Although recent evidence suggests that overlapping sense/antisense transcription is a common feature in higher eukaryotes, the possibility that overlapping transcripts could interact to each other and bear a specific biological function has not been explored. Here we show that a plethora of sense/antisense transcript pairs are co-expressed from 8q24.21 within the same cell and acquire a stable double-stranded RNA conformation. Interestingly, these molecules display predominantly nuclear localization and establish specific interactions with nuclear components. A detailed characterization of a particular sense/antisense pair (ndsRNA-2a) revealed that this molecule displays differential localization throughout the cell cycle, interacts with RCC1 and RAN and through the latter with the mitotic RANGAP1-SUMO1/RANBP2 complex. Notably, an increased number of bi/multi-nucleated cells and chromatin bridges were observed upon ndsRNA-2a overexpression, whereas strand-specific ndsRNA-2a knockdown leads to mitotic catastrophe and cell death. This suggests a functional role of ndsRNA-2a in cell cycle progression that critically requires its double stranded nature. Finally, the identification of hundreds of sense/antisense transcripts pairs harboring ndsRNA profile signatures and their regulation by cellular cues suggests that ndsRNAs constitute a novel class of regulatory molecules that are likely to be involved in a plethora of biological processes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62930GSE62936	RNA-Seq Analysis in hES/ iPS cell-derived neuronal samples	"We characterized the gene expression by Hierarchical Clustering and one-matrix clustering in hESC, day 12 progenitors, day 25-day 27, day82 differentiated hypothalamic neurons from hESCs and day 45 neurons derived from iPSCs generated from controls (2 independent) and BBS (Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, 3 independent) subjects."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62936GSE62952	Integrated genome and transcriptome sequencing from the same cell	Single-cell genomics and single-cell transcriptomics have recently emerged as powerful tools to study the biology of single cells at a genome-wide scale.

EPAS1 is distinct in comparison with other key regulators in terms of methylation profiles and downstream target genes. Genes predicted to be regulated by EPAS1 were enriched for biological processes including signaling, cell communications, and system developement. As EPAS1 downstream genes were significantly enriched for hypoxia responsive genes in endothelial cells, we tested EPAS1 function in human and mouse endothelial cells HUVEC and C166. EPAS1 knockdown by siRNA in endothelial cells impacted genes that significantly overlapped with EPAS1 downstream genes in lung tissue including hypoxia responsive genes. Methods: The cell lines of HUVEC (Lonza, MD, USA) and C166 (American Type Culture Collection, VA, USA) were cultured in the appropriate media at 37C with 5%% CO2. The cells were transfected with EPAS1 siRNA and non-targeting negative control siRNA (Life Technologies, CA, USA) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX as recommended transfection protocols by the manufacturer. After the treatments with 5nM Silencer Select siRNA (s4700 for EPAS1, s65525 for Epas1; Life Technologies, USA) for 48 hours, the total RNA was purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). The efficiencies of knocked down the EPAS1 expression were assessed by qPCR with 1.4%% for HUVEC, 3.2%% for C166. Approximately 250 ng of total RNA per sample were used for library construction by the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument with 100nt single read setting according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence reads were aligned to human genome assembly hg19 and mouse genome assembly mm10, respectively, using Tophat [96]. Total 23,228 human and 22,609 mouse genes were quantified using Cufflinks [96]. siRNA signatures were derived by comparing expression profiles of EPAS1 or Epas1 siRNAs with non-targeting siRNAs at paired t-test p-value cutoff 0.05 with resulting signature sizes of 2,796 and 3,730, and corresponding q-values [97] 0.11 and 0.07 for HUVEC and C166, respectively. Results: When comparing endothelial cells treated with EPAS1 siRNAs and scrambled siRNAs, we identified an EPAS1 siRNA signature consisting of 2796 and 3730 genes in human and mouse endothelial cell lines, respectively, whose expression levels significantly changed (t-test p-value<0.05), including EPAS1 itself (p-value = 0.002 and 0.02) and the EPAS1 downstream target gene VEGFA (p-value = 0.03 and 0.01). The EPAS1 siRNA signatures derived from human and mouse cell lines were highly consistent, with 695 genes in common to both signatures (p-value = 7.2x10-65). Both signatures not only significantly overlapped with EPAS1 downstream genes (p-value = 7.3x10-7 and 1.5x10-12), but also with hypoxia response genes in endothelial cells (Fishers Exact Test p-value = 5.8x10-8 and 1.2x10-12 in the human and mouse signatures, respectively). Moreover, the EPAS1 siRNA signatures consistently overlapped genes associated with the COPD severity phenotypes. These results together validate that EPAS1 causally regulates the downstream target genes we predicted, and that these genes in turn affect COPD development and progression."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62974GSE62982	Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor gamma- Deficiency in Endothelial Cells Impairs Angiogenic Capacity by Loss-of E2F1 Mediated Wnt Effector Genes	"Some of the functions and mechanisms of PPAR-mediated regulation of vascular homeostasis have been revealed, the potential role of PPAR in angiogenesis is obscure.

Through a uniquely large and informative cohort of transgene-free patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), along with their differentiated derivatives, we find that 7q11.23 CNV disrupt transcriptional circuits in disease-relevant pathways already at the pluripotent state. These alterations are then selectively amplified upon differentiation into disease-relevant lineages, thereby establishing the value of large iPSC cohorts in the elucidation of disease-relevant developmental pathways. In addition, we functionally define the quota of transcriptional dysregulation specifically caused by dosage imbalances in GTF2I (also known as TFII-I), a transcription factor in 7q11.23 thought to play a critical role in the two conditions, which we found associated to key repressive chromatin modifiers. Finally, we created an open-access web-based platform (accessible at http://bio.ieo.eu/wbs/ ) to make accessible our multi-layered datasets and integrate contributions by the entire community working on the molecular dissection of the 7q11.23 syndromes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63055GSE63079	JunB control of keratinocyte-mediated inflammation [RNA-seq]	"To determne JunB target gene in human keratincoytes Mice with epidermal deletion of JunB transcription factor displayed a psoriasis-like inflammation. The relevance of these findings to humans and the mechanisms mediating JunB function are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that impaired JunB function via gene silencing or overexpression of a dominant negative mutant increased human keratinocyte cell proliferation but decreased cell barrier function. RNA-seq revealed over 500 genes affected by JunB loss-of-function which included an upregulation of an array of proinflammatory molecules relevant to psoriasis. Among these were TNFa, CCL2, CXCL10, IL6R and SQSTM1, an adaptor protein involved in NF-kB activation. ChIP-Seq and gene reporter analyses showed that JunB directly suppressed SQSTM1 through binding to a consensus AP-1 cis-element located around 2 Kb upstream of SQSTM1-trasncription start site. Similar to JunB loss-of-function, SQSTM1-overexpression induced TNFa, CCL2 and CXCL10. Conversely, NF-kB-inhibition genetically with a mutant IkBa or pharmacologically with PDTC prevented cytokine, but not IL6R, induction by JunB-deficiency. Taken together, our findings indicate that JunB controls epidermal growth, barrier formation and proinflammatory responses through direct and indirect mechanisms, pinpointing SQSTM1 as a key mediator of JunB-suppression of NF-kB-dependent inflammation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63079GSE63085	Identification of a Molecular Signature for Acute Lyme Disease by Human Transcriptome Profiling	"Lyme disease is challenging to diagnose, as clinical manifestations are variable and current tools to detect nucleic acid or antibody responses from Borrelia burgdorferi infection have low sensitivity.

HnRNPC1/C2 can also bind to double-stranded DNA as a vitamin D response element-binding protein (VDRE-BP), thereby regulating transcriptional activity of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) bound to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). In this way hnRNPC1/C2 may act as a coupling factor for 1,25(OH)2D-directed transcription and RNA splicing. Studies using MG63 osteoblastic cells confirmed that 1,25(OH)2D-VDR mediated induction of the gene for the enzyme 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), involved CYP24A1-specific chromatin and RNA immunoprecipitation of hnRNPC1/C2. Furthermore, small interfering (siRNA) knockdown of hnRNPC1/C2 in MG63 cells and was associated with dysregulated expression of CYP24A1 and an alternatively spliced form of CYP24A1 (CYP24A1-variant 2). Genome-wide analysis of RNA expression and alternative splicing indicated that dual role of hnRNPC1/C2 in directing 1,25(OH)2D-mediated gene expression is not restricted to the classical VDR-target CYP24A1. Knockdown of hnRNPC1/C2 resulted in 3500 differentially expressed genes (DEG), and treatment with 1,25(OH)2D 324 DEG. A further 87 DEG were only observed in 1,25(OH)2D-treated cells in hnRNPC1/C2 knockdown cells. HnRNPC1/C2 knockdown or 1,25(OH)2D treatment also induced alternative splicing (AS) (5039 and 310 AS events respectively). Combined hnRNPC1/C2 knockdown and 1,25(OH)2D treatment resulted in significant overlap between DEG and AS genes, but this was not observed for 1,25(OH)2D treatment alone. These data indicate that hnRNPC1/C2 can act to couple transcriptional and splicing responses to 1,25(OH)2D by binding to both DNA and RNA. Similar mechanisms may also exist for other members of the hnRNP and steroid receptor family."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63086GSE63091	Transcriptome-wide modulation of splicing by the exon junction complex	"We report that knockdown of EJC core proteins, eIF4A3, Y14, Magoh, causes a transcript-wide changes in alternative splicing, as well as some transcriptional changes.

However, studying this disease has been challenging due to the lack of an animal model that can faithfully recapitulate the clinical phenotype of LVNC. To address this, we show that patient-specific hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) generated from a family with LVNC recapitulated a developmental defect consistent with the LVNC phenotype at the single-cell level. We then utilized hiPSC-CMs to show that increased transforming growth factor beta (TGF) signaling is one of the central mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of LVNC. LVNC hiPSC-CMs demonstrated decreased proliferative capacity due to abnormal activation of TGF signaling. Exome sequencing demonstrated a mutation in TBX20, which regulates TGF signaling, contributing to the LVNC phenotype. Our results demonstrate that hiPSC-CMs are a useful tool for the exploration of novel mechanisms underlying poorly understood cardiomyopathies such as LVNC.

Methyl CpG Binding Domain proteins MeCP2, MBD1 and MBD2 belong to the latter category. However, the exact contribution of each protein in the DNA methylation dependent transcriptional repression occurring during development and diseases remains elusive. Here we present MBD2 ChIPseq data generated from the endogenous protein in an isogenic cellular model of human mammary oncogenic transformation. In immortalized or transformed cells, MBD2 was found in one fourth of methylated regions and associated with transcriptional silencing. Depletion of MBD2 induces upregulations of genes bound by MBD2 and methylated in their transcriptional start site regions. MBD2 was partially redistributed on methylated DNA during oncogenic transformation, independently of DNA methylation changes. Genes downregulated during this transformation preferentially gained MBD2 binding sites on their promoter. Depletion of MBD2 in transformed cells induced the upregulation of some of these repressed genes, independently of the strategy used for the abrogation of oncosuppressive barriers. Our data confirm that MBD2 is a major interpret of DNA methylation, and show an unreported dynamic in this interpretation during oncogenic transformation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63234GSE63265	Combinatorial targeting of nuclear export and translation of RNA inhibits aggressive B-cell lymphoma	"Aggressive double and triple hit (DH/TH) DLBCL feature activation of Hsp90 stress pathways. Herein, we show that Hsp90 controls post-transcriptional dynamics of key mRNA species including those encoding BCL6, MYC and BCL2. Using a proteomics approach, we found that Hsp90 binds to and maintains activity of eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E). EIF4E drives nuclear export and translation of BCL6, MYC and BCL2 mRNA. eIF4E RIP-sequencing in DLBCL suggests that nuclear eIF4E controls an extended program that includes BCR signaling, cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation. Accordingly, eIF4E was required for survival of DLBCL including the most aggressive subtypes DH/TH lymphomas. Indeed, eIF4E inhibition induces tumor regression in cell line and patient-derived tumorgrafts of TH-DLBCL, even in the presence of elevated Hsp90 activity. Targeting Hsp90 is typically limited by counter-regulatory elevation of Hsp70B, which induces resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors. Surprisingly, we identify Hsp70 mRNA as an eIF4E target. In this way, eIF4E inhibition can overcome drug resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors. Accordingly, rational combinatorial inhibition of eIF4E and Hsp90 inhibitors resulted in cooperative anti-lymphoma activity in DH/TH DLBCL in vitro and in vivo."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63265GSE63283	Slit2 modifies VEGF-induced angiogenic responses in rabbit skeletal muscle by inducing capillary sprouting and decreasing vascular permeability via reduced eNOS activity	"Rationale: Slit2 is a possible modulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) - induced angiogenesis, but its effects have not been tested in large animal models. Objective: We studied the effect of Slit2 on therapeutic angiogenesis induced by VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) ligands Vammin and VEGF-DNC in vivo in rabbit skeletal muscles. The Slit2 target genes were also studied by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in endothelial cells. Methods and Results: Adenoviral intramuscular gene transfers were performed into rabbit hindlimbs. Confocal and multiphoton microscopy were used for blood vessel imaging. Signaling experiments and gene expression analyses were performed to study mechanisms of Slit2 action. Slit2 decreased VEGFR2-mediated vascular permeability. It also reduced VEGFR2-mediated increase in blood perfusion and capillary enlargement, whereas sprouting of the capillaries was increased. Slit2 gene transfer alone did not have any effects on vascular functions or morphology. VEGFR2 activation was not affected by Slit2, but eNOS phosphorylation was diminished. The transcriptome profiling showed Slit2 downregulating angiogenesis-related genes such as nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) and Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) as well as genes related to endothelial cell migration and vascular permeability. Conclusions: Combining Slit2 with VEGFs adjusts VEGFR2-mediated angiogenic effects into a more physiological direction. This possibly allows the use of higher VEGF vector doses to achieve a more widespread vector and VEGF distribution in the target tissues leading to a better therapeutic outcome while reducing excess vascular permeability."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63283GSE63314	Stably-paused genes revealed through inhibition of transcription initiation by the TFIIH inhibitor Triptolide	"Transcription by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) in metazoan is regulated in several steps, including preinitiation complex (PIC) formation, initiation, Pol II escape, productive elongation, cotranscriptional RNA-processing and termination. Genome-wide studies have demonstrated that the phenomenon of promoter-bound Pol II pausing is widespread, especially for genes involved in developmental and stimulus-responsive pathways. However, a mechanistic understanding of the paused Pol II states at promoters is limited. For example, at a global level, its unclear to what extent the engaged paused Pol II is stably tethered to the promoter or undergoes rapid cycles of initiation and termination. Here we used the small molecule Triptolide (TPL), an XPB/TFIIH inhibitor, to block transcriptional initiation followed by measuring Pol II occupancy by ChIP-seq. This inhibition of initiation enables us to investigate different states of paused Pol II. Specifically, our global analysis reveals that most genes with paused Pol II, as defined by pausing index, show significant clearance of Pol II during the period of TPL treatment. Our study further identifies a group of genes with unexpectedly stably-paused Pol II, with unchanged Pol II occupancy even after one hour of inhibition of initiation. This group of genes constitutes a small portion of all paused genes defined by the conventional criterion of pausing index. These findings could pave the way for evaluating the contribution of different elongation/pausing factors on different states of Pol II pausing in developmental and other stimulus-responsive pathways."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63314GSE63344	"Gene expression profile of wt-, S473A- and S473D-KAP1-re-expression in KAP1-depleted MDA-MB-231 cell"	"We study the gene regulation function of serine 473 phosphorylation of KAP1 (pS473-KAP1) in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Here, we provide evidence for pre-patterning of differentiation-driven formation of lamin A/C LADs by domains of histone H2B modified by the nutrient sensor O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (H2BGlcNAc), which we term GADs. We demonstrate a two-step process of lamin A/C LAD formation during in vitro adipogenesis, involving (i) a spreading of lamin A/C-chromatin interactions during the transition from progenitor cell proliferation to cell cycle arrest, and (ii) a genome-scale redistribution these interactions through a process of LAD exchange within hours of adipogenic induction. Chromatin state modeling reveals that lamin A/C LADs can be found both in active and repressive chromatin contexts which can be influenced by cell differentiation status. De novo formation of adipogenic lamin A/C LADs occurs non-randomly on GADs, consisting of megabase-size intergenic and repressive chromatin domains. Accordingly, while pre-differentiation lamin A/C LADs are gene-rich, post-differentiation LADs harbor repressive features reminiscent of lamin B1 LADs. Moreover, release of lamin A/C from genes directly involved in glycolysis concurs with their transcriptional upregulation after adipogenic induction, and with concordant downstream elevations in H2BGlcNAc levels and O-GlcNAc cycling. Our results unveil an epigenetic pre-patterning of adipogenic LADs by GADs, suggesting a coupling of developmentally regulated lamin A/C-genome interactions to a metabolically sensitive chromatin modification."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63346GSE63375	Pre-mRNA Splicing is Facilitated by an Optimal RNA Polymerase II Elongation Rate	Transcription and pre-mRNA alternative splicing was analyzed by in isogenic human HEK293 cell lines that inducibly express a-amanitin resistant mutants of the RNA polymerase II large subunit with slow and fast elongation rates.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63375GSE63381	The genomic landscape of nasopharyngeal carcinoma	"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has extremely skewed ethnic and geographic distributions, is poorly understood at the genetic level and is in need of effective therapeutic approaches. Here we determined the mutational landscape of 128 cases with NPC using whole-exome and targeted deep sequencing, as well as SNP array analysis. These approaches revealed a distinct mutational signature and nine significantly mutated genes, many of which have not been implicated previously in NPC. Notably, integrated analysis showed enrichment of genetic lesions affecting several important cellular processes and pathways, including chromatin modification, ERBB-PI3K signaling and autophagy machinery. Further functional studies suggested the biological relevance of these lesions to the NPC malignant phenotype. In addition, we uncovered a number of new druggable candidates because of their genomic alterations.

These cell lines differ by a single amino acid substitution (H1047R) caused by single nucleotide change in one allele of the PIK3CA gene which encodes the catalytic subunit p110 of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The H1047R mutation of PIK3CA is one of the most frequently encountered somatic cancer-specific mutations. In MCF-10A, this mutation induces an extensive cellular reorganization that far exceeds the known signaling activities of PI3K. The changes are highly diverse; with examples in structural protein levels, the DNA repair machinery and sterol synthesis. Gene set enrichment analysis reveals a highly significant concordance of the genes differentially expressed in MCF-10A-H1047R cells and the established protein and RNA signatures of basal breast cancer. No such concordance was found with the specific gene signatures of other histological types of breast cancer.

JMJD1C is directly recruited by AML1-ETO to its target genes and regulates their expression by maintaining low H3K9me2 levels. Analyses in JMJD1C knockout mice also establish a JMJD1C requirement for AML1-ETOs ability to increase proliferation.

However, the spatiotemporal mechanisms by which PRC2 achieves diverse epigenomes for specific tissue or cellular contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we discovered that LATS2 knockout causes dysregulation of PRC2 and subsequent transcriptome changes for differentiation in both mouse and human cells. LATS2 depletion dependent dysregulation of PRC2 also effects H3K4me3 and forms negative feedback loop for maintenance of PRC2. Further analyses reveal that LATS2 on chromatin binds to EZH2 and LATS2 has ability to phosphorylate PRC2 in vitro. These LATS2 dependent H3K27me3 targets are highly induced during neurogenesis, and statistical analysis of glioblastoma multiforme reveals that LATS2-high cases show more dedifferentiated transcriptome and poor prognosis with silencing of H3K27me3 targets.

Here we report the preferential and high sensitivity of TNBCs to BET bromodomain inhibitors such as JQ1 manifested by cell cycle arrest in early G1, apoptosis, and induction of markers of luminal epithelial differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The sensitivity of TNBC and other tumor types to BET inhibition establishes a rationale for clinical investigation, and a motivation to understand mechanisms of resistance. After engendering acquired resistance to BET inhibition in previously sensitive TNBCs, we utilized integrative approaches to identify a unique mechanism of epigenomic resistance to this epigenetic therapy. Resistant cells remain dependent on BRD4, confirmed by RNA interference. However, TNBC cells adapt to BET bromodomain inhibition by re-recruitment of unmutated BRD4 to super-enhancers, now in a bromodomain-independent manner. Proteomic studies of resistant TNBC identify hyper-phosphorylation of BRD4 and strong association with MED1.

"We report a negative correlation of invasiveness with REST expression. In addition, one alternatively spliced product (ASP) of REST, REST-003, shows a positive correlation with invasiveness. REST has a well-established role in regulating transcription of genes important for neuronal development. Its role in cancer, though significant, is less well understood. We would like to investigate the effect of REST on invasive phenotype. In order to do so, we downregulate REST by siRNA treatment in weakly invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells in which REST is expressed highly: 1) si-GAPDH (control), two si-RESTs (2)si-REST_1 and 3) si-REST_2). Conversely, we overexpress REST by transfection of wt-REST cDNA in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells in which REST is expressed at the low level: 4) EGFP (control), 5) mt-REST (another control) and 6) wt-REST. REST (repressor element-1 (RE-1) silencing transcription factor) contains a DNA-binding domain that is localized within eight zinc fingers and two repressor domains located at the N-terminal and C-terminal, respectively.

Here we show that the human basal RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery and core promoter are inherently unidirectional, and that reverse-oriented transcripts originate from their own cognate reverse-directed core promoters. In vitro transcription analysis and mapping of nascent transcripts in cells revealed that core promoters are unidirectional and that sequences at reverse start sites are similar to those of their forward counterparts. The use of DNase I accessibility to define proximal promoter borders revealed that about half of promoters are unidirectional and that these unidirectional promoters are depleted at their upstream edges of reverse core promoter sequences and their associated chromatin features.

The precursors self-assembled into 3-dimensional (3D) neural constructs with cortically organized neuronal and glial cells, interconnected vascular networks, and ramified microglia. Replicate constructs were highly reproducible by RNA sequencing (Spearmans correlation coefficients,   0.97) and robustly expressed neurogenesis, vasculature development, and microglia genes.

Different members of this enzyme family catalyze different types of protein methylation at the terminal nitrogen atoms of arginine residues, forming monomethylated arginine (MMA), asymmetrically dimethylated arginine (ADMA) and symmetrically dimethylated arginine (SDMA). The last member of this family, PRMT9, is characterized in detail here. We identify two spliceosome-associated proteins, SAP145 (SF3B2) and SAP49 (SF3B4), as PRMT9 binding partners, linking PRMT9 to U2snRNP maturation. We show that SAP145 is methylated by PRMT9 at arginine 508 (R508). Amino acid analysis and a methyl-specific antibody revealed the formation of MMA and SDMA, and PRMT9 thus joins PRMT5 as the only mammalian enzymes that can deposit the SDMA mark. Methylation of the SAP145R508 generates a binding site for the Tudor domain of SMN, and RNA-seq analysis reveals gross splicing changes when PRMT9 levels are attenuated. These studies identify PRMT9 as a non-histone methyltransferase that primes the U2snRNP for interaction with SMN."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63953GSE64016	Single cell RNA-seq data of human hESCs to evaluate Oscope - a statistical pipeline for identifying oscillatory genes in unsynchronized single cell RNA-Seq	"Oscillatory gene expression is fundamental to mammalian development, but technologies to monitor expression oscillations are limited.

"Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare different RNA extraction methods using a mixture design that allows the relative changes of the majority of genes profiled to be estimated. A number of samples were degraded to allow us to compare methods for dealing with more variable samples. Methods - Cell Culture: Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines NCI-H1975 and HCC827 from a range of passages (2-4) were grown on 3 separate occasions in RPMI media (Gibco) supplemented with Glutamax and 10%% fetal calf serum to a 70%% confluence. To replicate common experimental conditions cell lines were treated with 0.01%% Dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma), which is commonly used as a vehicle in drug treatment experiments. After 6 hours of treatment, cells were collected, snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 degrees C until required. Methods - RNA preparation: Total RNA was extracted from between half a million and million cells using Total RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek) with on-column DNAse treatment accorting to the kit instructions. RNA concentration for each pair of samples to be mixed was equalised to ~100 ng/l using Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies). Replicates were pooled in known proportions to obtain mixtures ranging from pure NCI-H1975 (100:0) to pure HCC827 (0:100) and intermediate mixtures ranging from 75:25 to 50:50 to 25:75 NCI-H1975:HCC827. All mixtures corresponding to the second replicate were split into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was left intact (we refer to this as the 'good' replicate), while the second aliquot was degraded to produce known outlier samples by incubation at 37 degrees C for 7 days in a thermal cycler with a heated lid. 10 l from each replicated mixture (both good and degraded) were used for Next Generation Sequencing library preparation using two kits: Illumina TruSeq Total Stranded RNA with Ribozero (TotalRNA) and Illumina TruSeq RNA v2 (mRNA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Completed libraries were sequenced on HiSeq 2500 with TruSeq SBS Kit v4- HS reagents (Illumina) as 100 bp single-end reads at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF), Melbourne. Approximately 30 million 100 bp single-end reads were obtained for each sample. Reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 and mapped to known genomic features at the gene level using the Rsubread package (version 1.16.1) (Liao et al. 2013).

Here, we challenge that view by demonstrating that the infection of human dendritic cells with a live pathogenic bacteria is associated with rapid changes in methylation levels at thousands of loci. We performed an integrated analysis of data on genome-wide DNA methylation, histone mark patterns, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression, before and after infection. We found that infection-induced changes in methylation rarely occur at promoter regions and instead localize to distal enhancer elements. Active demethylation is associated with extensive epigenetic remodeling, including the gain of histone activation marks and the induction of enhancer RNAs, and is strongly predictive of changes in the expression levels of nearby genes. Collectively, our observations show that active, rapid changes in DNA methylation in enhancers play a previously unappreciated role in regulating the transcriptional response of immune cells to infection."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64179GSE64182	Bacterial Infection Remodels the DNA Methylation Landscape of Human Dendritic Cells (wtRNA-Seq)	"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark thought to be robust to environmental perturbations on a short time scale.

We determined the genome-wide binding of the TAK1-controlled NF-B subunit p65 in relation to active enhancers and promoters of transcribed genes by ChIP-seq experiments. Out of 35,000 active enhancer regions, 410 H3K4me1-positive enhancers show interleukin (IL)-1-induced H3K27ac and p65 binding. Inhibition of TAK1, IKK2 or depletion of p65 blocked inducible enhancer activation and gene expression. As exemplified by the CXC chemokine cluster located on chromosome 4, the TAK1-p65 pathway also regulates the recruitment kinetics of the histone acetyltransferase CBP, of NF-B p50 and of AP-1 transcription factors to both, promoters and enhancers. This study provides a high resolution view of epigenetic changes occurring during the IL-1 response and allows the first genome-wide identification of a novel class of inducible p65 NF-B-dependent enhancers in epithelial cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64185GSE64283	Tissue-specific circular RNA induction during human fetal development	"The pervasive expression of circular RNA from protein coding loci is a recently discovered feature of many eukaryotic gene expression programs. Computational methods to discover and quantify circular RNA are essential to the study of the mechanisms of circular RNA biogenesis and potential functional roles they may play. In this paper, we present a new statistical algorithm that increases the sensitivity and specificity of circular RNA detection.by discovering and quantifying circular and linear RNA splicing events at both annotated exon boundaries and in un-annotated regions of the genome Unlike previous approaches which rely on heuristics like read count and homology between exons predicted to be circularized to determine confidence in prediction of circular RNA expression, our algorithm is a statistical approach. We have used this algorithm to discover general induction of circular RNAs in many tissues during human fetal development. We find that some regions of the brain show marked enrichment for genes where circular RNA is the dominant isoform. Beyond this global trend, specific circular RNAs are tissue specifically induced during fetal development, including a circular isoform of NCX1 in the developing fetal heart that, by 20 weeks, is more highly expressed than the linear isoform as well as beta-actin. In addition, while the vast majority of circular RNA production occurs at canonical U2 (major spliceosome) splice sites, we find the first examples of developmentally induced circular RNAs processed by the U12 (minor) spliceosome, and an enriched propensity of U12 donors to splice into circular RNA at un-annotated, rather than annotated, exons. Together, our algorithm and its results suggest a potentially significant role for circular RNA in human development."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64283GSE64317	Bromodomain inhibition of the transcriptional coactivators CBP/EP300 as a therapeutic strategy to target the IRF4 network in multiple myeloma (RNA-Seq)	"Pharmacological inhibition of chromatin co-regulatory factors represents a clinically validated strategy to modulate oncogenic signaling through selective attenuation of gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Phenotypic effects are preceded by the direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4 and the subsequent down-regulation of the IRF4 transcriptional program. Ectopic expression of IRF4 antagonizes the phenotypic effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition and prevents the suppression of the IRF4 target c-MYC. These findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64317GSE64367	Epigenomic profiling reveals the key function of histone H3K9 methylation during tumor transformation process	"To understand transcriptome and epigenome profilings alteration during breast cancer initiation and development, we constructed a in vitro breast cancer transformation model.

We provide evidence that human SLFN5, an interferon (IFN)- inducible member of the family, exhibits key roles in controlling motility and invasiveness of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. Our studies define the mechanism by which this occurs, demonstrating that SLFN5 negatively controls expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 and -13 and several other genes involved in the control of malignant cell motility. Importantly, our data establish that SLFN5 expression correlates with a better overall survival in a large cohort of patients with RCC.

The KSHV ORF57 protein is a conserved posttranscriptional regulator of gene expression that is essential for virus replication. ORF57 is multifunctional, but most of its activities are directly linked to its ability to bind RNA. We globally identified virus and host RNAs bound by ORF57 during lytic reactivation in PEL cells using high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP). As expected, ORF57-bound RNA fragments mapped throughout the KSHV genome, including the known ORF57 ligand PAN RNA. In agreement with previously published ChIP results, we observed that ORF57 bound RNAs near the oriLyt regions of the genome. Examination of the host RNA fragments revealed that a subset of the ORF57-bound RNAs was derived from transcript 5 ends. The position of these 5-bound fragments correlated closely with the 5-most exonintron junction of the pre-mRNA. We selected four candidates (BTG1, EGR1, ZFP36, and TNFSF9) and analyzed their pre-mRNA and mRNA levels during lytic phase. Analysis of both steady-state and newly made RNAs revealed that these candidate ORF57-bound pre-mRNAs persisted for longer periods of time throughout infection than control RNAs, consistent with a role for ORF57 in pre-mRNA metabolism. In addition, exogenous expression of ORF57 was sufficient to increase the pre-mRNA levels and, in one case, the mRNA levels of the putative ORF57 targets. These results demonstrate that ORF57 interacts with specific host pre-mRNAs during lytic reactivation and alters their processing, likely by stabilizing pre-mRNAs. These data suggest that ORF57 is involved in modulating host gene expression in addition to KSHV gene expression during lytic reactivation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64413GSE64417	Induction of circular RNA in fetal heart development recapitulated in in vitro differentiation	"We discovered induction of circular RNA in human fetal tissues, including the heart.

However, the mechanisms driving such atypical gene expression programs are incompletely understood. Here, our transcriptional profiling of a cohort of 50 primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that transcription read-through beyond the termination site is a source of transcriptome diversity in cancer cells. Amongst the genes most frequently mutated in ccRCC, we identified SETD2 inactivation as a potent enhancer of transcription read-through. We further show that invasion of neighbouring genes and generation of RNA chimeras are functional outcomes of transcription read-through. We identified the BCL2 oncogene as one of such invaded genes and detected a novel chimera, the CTSC-RAB38, in 20%% of ccRCC samples. Collectively, our data highlight a novel link between transcription read-through and aberrant expression of oncogenes and chimeric transcripts that is prevalent in cancer."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64451GSE64486	The transcriptome of Kawasaki Disease arteritis	"Background: Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a childhood illness of suspected infectious etiology that causes medium-sized muscular arteritis, most critically affecting the coronary arteries. No single diagnostic test exists, hampering early diagnosis and treatment. Approximately 25%% of untreated patients develop coronary artery disease, and children who are treated with intravenous gammaglobulin but do not respond are also at high risk. Subacute/chronic arteritis and luminal myofibroblastic proliferation are the pathologic processes occurring in KD CA after the second week of illness, when neutrophilic necrotizing arteritis has subsided. The specific dysregulated immune pathways contributing to subacute/chronic arteritis have been unknown, hampering the development of effective immunomodulatory therapies for patients not responding to intravenous gammaglobulin therapy. Methods and Results: Deep RNA sequencing was performed on KD (n=8) and childhood control (n=7) coronary artery tissues, revealing 1074 differentially expressed mRNAs. Molecular pathways involving T helper cell, cytotoxic T lymphocyte, dendritic cells, and antigen presentation were the most significantly dysregulated. There was significant upregulation of immunoglobulin and type I interferon-stimulated genes. 80 upregulated extracellular genes encoding secreted proteins are candidate biomarkers of KD arteritis. Conclusions: The immune transcriptional profile in KD coronary artery tissues is primarily T helper and cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated, and has features of an antiviral immune response such as type I interferon-stimulated gene expression. This first report of the KD coronary artery transcriptome identifies specific dysregulated immune response pathways that can inform the development of new therapies for and biomarkers of KD arteritis, and provide direction for future etiologic studies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64486GSE64513	FOXD3 is a novel tumor suppressor in lung cancer	"The transcription factor forkhead box D3 (FoxD3) is a transcriptional factor which belongs to forkhead box (Fox) transcription factor family. The functions of FOXD3 in embryogenesis and in the development of neural crest cells have been clearly defined. Its tumor suppressor function hasbeen found in many types of cancer in recent years. However, the study about its roles in lung cancerdevelopment is still lacking. Our study found that deficiency of FoxD3 in lung cancer enhanced cell growth and cell invasion. RNA-sequence analysis demonstrated that loss of FoxD3 mainly affected cell cycle progression related gene expression. Knockdown of FoxD3 led to G2-M cell accumulation with up-regulation of DNA replication licensing factor MCM5 and MCM4 as well as cell cycle regulator polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1) and CDC6. Over-expression of those genesin lung cancer was associated with poor clinical outcomes of lung cancer patients.

Clinical translation is impeded by limited engraftment of human (h)PSC-multipotent progenitor cells (MPP). This barrier suggests that additional cues are required for definitive hematopoiesis. We hypothesized that vascular niche producing Notch ligands Jagged-1 (JAG1) and Delta-like ligand-4 (DLL4) would drive definitive hematopoiesis. To test our hypothesis, hes2 human embryonic stem cells (hESC) 2 and Macaca nemestrina (Mn) iPSC line-7 were differentiated with cytokines  endothelial cells (EC), which express JAG1 and DLL4. EC co-culture supported emergence of 8-fold more CD34+CD45+ cells compared to co-culture with cytokines  ECs with JAG1 or DLL4 knockdown. EC-induced cells exhibit Notch activation and express HSC-specific targets of Notch signaling RUNX1 and GATA2. EC-induced PSC-MPP engraft at a higher level in NSG mice compared to cytokine-induced cells (10%% >5 months), and selection increased engraftment (30%%). Long-term engraftment and the myeloid-to-lymphoid ratio achieved with vascular niche induction is similar to levels achieved for cord blood MPP and up to 20-fold higher than hPSC-MPP engraftment. Our findings identify a previously underappreciated role for endothelial Notch ligands in PSC definitive hematopoiesis and production of long-term engrafting CD34+ cells and suggest they are critical for HSC emergence."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64644GSE64655	A Cell-based Systems Biology Assessment of Human Blood to Monitor Immune Responses After Influenza Vaccination	"Systems biology is an approach to comprehensively study complex interactions within a biological system. Most published systems vaccinology studies have utilized whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to monitor the immune response after vaccination. Because human blood is comprised of multiple hematopoietic cell types, the potential for masking responses of under-represented cell populations is increased when analyzing whole blood or PBMC. To investigate the contribution of individual cell types to the immune response after vaccination, we established a rapid and efficient method to purify human T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), monocytes, and neutrophils from fresh venous blood. Purified cells were fractionated and processed in a single day. RNA-Seq and quantitative shotgun proteomics were performed to determine expression profiles for each cell type prior to and after inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination. Our results show that transcriptomic and proteomic profiles generated from purified immune cells differ significantly from PBMC. Differential expression analysis for each immune cell type also shows unique transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles as well as changing biological networks at early time points after vaccination.

Here, high-throughput sequencing and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments of human Argonaute (Ago) during HCV infection showed robust Ago binding on the HCV 5UTR, at known and predicted miR-122 sites. On the human transcriptome, we observed reduced Ago binding and functional mRNA de-repression of miR-122 targets during virus infection. This miR-122 sponge effect could be relieved and redirected to miR-15 targets by swapping the miRNA tropism of the virus. Single-cell expression data from reporters containing miR-122 sites showed significant de-repression during HCV infection depending on expression level and number of sites. We describe a quantitative mathematical model of HCV induced miR-122 sequestration and propose that such miR-122 inhibition by HCV RNA may result in global de-repression of host miR-122 targets, providing an environment fertile for the long-term oncogenic potential of HCV."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64677GSE64712	Functional characterization of human T cell hyporesponsiveness induced by CTLA4-Ig	"During activation, T cells integrate multiple signals from APCs and cytokine milieu. The blockade of these signals can have clinical benefits as exemplified by CTLA4-Ig, which blocks interaction of B7 co-stimulatory molecules on APCs with CD28 on T cells. Variants of CTLA4-Ig, abatacept and belatacept are FDA approved as immunosuppressive agents in arthritis and transplantation whereas murine studies suggested that CTLA4-Ig can be beneficial in a number of other diseases. However, detailed analysis of human CD4 cell hyporesponsivness induced by CTLA4-Ig has not been performed. Herein, we established a model to study effect of CTLA4-Ig on the activation of human nave T cells in a human mixed lymphocytes system. Comparison of human CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of CTLA4-Ig, showed that co-stimulation blockade during TCR activation does not affect NFAT signaling but results in decreased activation of NF-kB and AP-1 transcription factors followed by profound decrease in proliferation and cytokine production. The resulting T cells become hyporesponsive to secondary activation and, although capable of receiving TCR signals, fail to proliferate or produce cytokines, demonstrating properties of anergic cells. However, unlike some models of T cell anergy, these cells did not possess increased levels of TCR signaling inhibitor CBLB.

Previously, we engineered an IL-2 superkine (H9) with enhanced affinity for IL-2R. Here, we describe next-generation IL-2 variants that function as receptor signaling clamps. They retain high-affinity for IL-2R, thereby inhibiting binding of endogenous IL-2, but their engagement of c is weakened, thereby attenuating IL-2R-c heterodimerization. These IL-2 analogues act as partial agonists and can differentially affect lymphocytes poised at distinct activation thresholds. Moreover, one of these variants potently antagonized IL-2 and IL-15 signaling and function better than blocking antibodies against IL-2R or IL-2R. Furthermore, this mutein prolonged survival in a model of graft versus host disease and blocked spontaneous proliferation of smoldering adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) T cells ex vivo.

We used transcriptomic analysis of sensitive tumour cells and xenograft tumours treated with vehicle, vemurafenib, or crizotinib to identify the transcriptional drivers and to dissect the TIS in melanoma (A375, Colo800, UACC62) and lung adenocarcinoma (H3122). In addition, we utilize cell typespecific mRNA purification by translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) to identify pathways that are up-regulated in resistant cells (A375R) in response to the regressing tumour microenvironment."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64741GSE64795	Type I interferon regulates the expression of long non-coding RNAs [RNA-seq]	"Interferons (IFNs) are key players in the antiviral response. IFN sensing by the cell activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) able to induce an antiviral state by affecting viral replication and release. IFN also induces the expression of ISGs that function as negative regulators to limit the strength and duration of IFN response. The ISGs identified so far belong to coding genes. However, only a small proportion of the transcriptome corresponds to coding transcripts and it has been estimated that there could be as many coding as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). To address whether IFN can also regulate the expression of lncRNAs, we analyzed the transcriptome of HuH7 cells treated or not with IFN2 by expression arrays. Analysis of the arrays showed increased levels of several well-characterized coding genes that respond to IFN both at early or late times. Furthermore, we identified several IFN-stimulated or -downregulated lncRNAs (ISRs and IDRs). Further validation showed that ISR2, 8, and 12 expression mimics that of their neighboring genes GBP1, IRF1, and IL6, respectively, all related to the IFN response. These genes are induced in response to different doses of IFN2 in different cell lines at early (ISR2 or 8) or later (ISR12) time points. IFN also induced the expression of these lncRNAs. ISR2 and 8 were also induced by an influenza virus unable to block the IFN response but not by other wild-type lytic viruses tested. Surprisingly, both ISR2 and 8 were significantly upregulated in cultured cells and livers from patients infected with HCV. Increased levels of ISR2 were also detected in patients chronically infected with HIV. This is relevant as genome-wide guilt-by-association studies predict that ISR2, 8, and 12 may function in viral processes, in the IFN pathway and the antiviral response. Therefore, we propose that these lncRNAs could be induced by IFN to function as positive or negative regulators of the antiviral response."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64795GSE64801	Common inflammatory pathways between NEC and Crohn's disease	"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most frequent life-threatening gastrointestinal disease experienced by premature infant occuring in neonatal intensive care units. NEC is associated with severe intestinal inflammation, intestinal perforation leading to mortality. The challenge for neonatologists is to detect early clinical manifestations of NEC. Therefore, one of the strategies to prevent or treat NEC would be to develop an early diagnostic tool allowing identification of preterm infants either at risk of developing NEC or at the onset of the disease. Illuminas deep sequencing technology (RNA-seq) was used to establish the gene expression profile between resected ileal healthy preterm (control, n=5) and NEC diagnosed preterm infant (NEC, n=9) and analyzed by IPA Core analysis system. IPA analysis indicated that the most significant functional pathways overrepresented in NEC neonates were associated with innate immune functions, such as altered T and B cell signaling, B cell development, and the role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses. Among genes that were strongly modulated in NEC neonates, we observed a high degree of similarity with those linked to the development of IBD. By comparing gene expression patterns between NEC and Crohns disease, we identified several new potential protein targets for helping to predict and/or diagnose NEC in preterm infant. Gene expression profile revealed an uncontrolled innate immune response in the intestine of NEC neonates. Moreover, comparative analysis between NEC and Crohns disease evidenced high degree of similarity between these two inflammatory diseases and allowed us to identify several new potential NEC biomarkers."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64801GSE64810	mRNA-Seq Expression profiling of human post-mortem BA9 brain tissue for Huntington's Disease and neurologically normal individuals	"Huntingtons Disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Transcriptional dysregulation in the human HD brain has been documented but is incompletely understood. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression in human prefrontal cortex from 20 HD and 49 neuropathologically normal controls using next generation high-throughput sequencing. Surprisingly, 19%% (5,480) of the 28,087 confidently detected genes are differentially expressed (FDR<0.05) and are predominantly up-regulated. A novel hypothesis-free geneset enrichment method that dissects large gene lists into functionally and transcriptionally related groups discovers that the differentially expressed genes are enriched for immune response, neuroinflammation, and developmental genes. Markers for all major brain cell types are observed, suggesting that HD invokes a systemic response in the brain area studied. Unexpectedly, the most strongly differentially expressed genes are a homeotic gene set (represented by Hox and other homeobox genes), that are almost exclusively expressed in HD, a profile not widely implicated in HD pathogenesis. The significance of transcriptional changes of developmental processes in the HD brain is poorly understood and warrants further investigation. The role of inflammation and the significance of non-neuronal involvement in HD pathogenesis suggest anti-inflammatory therapeutics may offer important opportunities in treating HD."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64810GSE64813	Gene Networks Specific for Innate Immunity Define Post-traumatic Stress Disorder [RNA-Seq]	"The molecular factors involved in the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remain poorly understood. Previous transcriptomic studies investigating the mechanisms of PTSD apply targeted approaches to identify individual genes under a cross-sectional framework lack a holistic view of the behaviours and properties of these genes at the system-level. Here we sought to apply an unsupervised gene-network based approach to a prospective experimental design using whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq gene expression from peripheral blood leukocytes of U.S. Marines (N=188), obtained both pre- and post-deployment to conflict zones. We identified discrete groups of co-regulated genes (i.e., co-expression modules) and tested them for association to PTSD. We identified one module at both pre- and post-deployment containing putative causal signatures for PTSD development displaying an over-expression of genes enriched for functions of innate-immune response and interferon signalling (Type-I and Type-II). Importantly, these results were replicated in a second non-overlapping independent dataset of U.S. Marines (N=96), further outlining the role of innate immune and interferon signalling genes within co-expression modules to explain at least part of the causal pathophysiology for PTSD development. A second module, consequential of trauma exposure, contained PTSD resiliency signatures and an over-expression of genes involved in hemostasis and wound responsiveness suggesting that chronic levels of stress impair proper wound healing during/after exposure to the battlefield while highlighting the role of the hemostatic system as a clinical indicator of chronic-based stress. These findings provide novel insights for early preventative measures and advanced PTSD detection, which may lead to interventions that delay or perhaps abrogate the development of PTSD. We used RNA-Sequencing gene expression to characterize both prognostic and diagnostic molecular signatures associated to PTSD risk and PTSD status compared to control subjects."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64813GSE64818	Evolutionary analysis across mammals reveals distinct classes of long noncoding RNAs	"Recent advances in transcriptome sequencing have enabled the discovery of thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) across many species. Though several lncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in diverse biological processes, the functions and mechanisms of most lncRNAs remain unknown. Two significant obstacles lie between transcriptome sequencing and functional characterization of lncRNAs: identifying truly non-coding genes from de novo reconstructed transcriptomes, and prioritizing the hundreds of resulting putative lncRNAs for downstream experimental interrogation. We present slncky, a computational lncRNA discovery tool that produces a high-quality set of lncRNAs from RNA-sequencing data and further uses evolutionary constraint to prioritize lncRNAs that are likely to be functionally important. Our automated filtering pipeline is comparable to manual curation efforts and more sensitive than previously published computational approaches. Furthermore, we develop a sensitive alignment pipeline for aligning lncRNA loci and propose new evolutionary metrics relevant for analyzing sequence and transcript evolution. Our analysis reveals that evolutionary selection acts in several distinct patterns, and uncovers two notable classes of intergenic lncRNAs: one showing strong purifying selection on RNA sequence and another where constraint is restricted to the regulation but not the sequence of the transcript."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64818GSE64854	Expression by CD133+ cells isolated from the adult human exocrine pancreas	Expression from CD133+ cells isolated from adult human exocrine tissue was compared to a CD133-depleted cell population	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64854GSE64912	RNA-Sequencing of human papillary thyroid carcinomas	"RNA-Sequencing analysis of 18 papillary thyroid carcinoma biopsies and of 4 healthy donors' thyroids.

We previously reported that mTORC1 was inhibited and overall translation was reduced in RBS cells. Treatment of RBS cells with L-leucine partially rescued mTOR function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division. In this study, we use RBS as a model for mTOR inhibition and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine genome-wide effects of L-leucine. The translational efficiency of many genes is increased with Lleucine in RBS cells including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and mitochondrial function. snoRNAs are strongly upregulated in RBS cells, but decreased with L-leucine. Imprinted genes, including H19 and GTL2, are differentially expressed in RBS cells consistent with contribution to mTORC1 control. This study reveals dramatic effects of L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 and supports that ESCO2 function is required for normal gene expression and translation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64962GSE65000	Human-specific gene ARHGAP11B promotes basal progenitor amplification and neocortex expansion	"The evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex reflects increased amplification of basal progenitors in the subventricular zone, producing more neurons during fetal corticogenesis. Here, we analyze the transcriptomes of distinct progenitor subpopulations isolated by a novel approach from developing mouse and human neocortex. We identify 56 genes preferentially expressed in human apical and basal radial glia that lack mouse orthologs. Among these, ARHGAP11B has the highest degree of radial glia-specific expression. ARHGAP11B arose from partial duplication of the Rho GTPase-activating-proteinencoding ARHGAP11A on the human lineage after separation from the chimpanzee lineage. Expression of ARHGAP11B in embryonic mouse neocortex promotes basal progenitor generation and self-renewal, and can increase cortical plate area and induce gyrification.

Method: By using subsegmental bronchial provocation with allergen (SBP-AG) protocol, we obtained BAL fluids, before and 48 hours after allergen challenge in the subjects enrolled in the protocol. Alveolar macrophages were purified from the BAL fluids and total RNA was isolated. Next-generation sequencing data were generated by using the Illumina system. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 75 million sequence reads per sample to the human genome and identified 29,691 transcripts in the macrophage mRNAs. Among them, the change in the expression profiles of 37 transcripts were statistically significant. Conclusions: It has been well accepted that Th2 cytokine enriched environment transforms the phenotype of macrophages into alternatively activated form. However, the details of a genome-wide gene expression profiles of macrophages were not well investigated.

We show that genomic analysis of acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitors revealed key driver genes but failedto adequately account for clinical resistance. From a large-scale comparative analysis of temporal transcriptomes from patient-matched tumor biopsies, we discovered highly recurrent differential expression and signature outputs of c-MET, LEF1 and YAP1 as drivers of acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance. Moreover, integration of gene- and signature-based transcriptomic analysis revealed profound CD8 T cell deficiency detected in half of resistant melanomas in association with downregulation of dendritic cells and antigen presentation. We also propose a major methylomic basis to transcriptomic evolution under MAPK inhibitor selection.

Here we report that mutations affecting the splicing factor SRSF2 alter its normal RNA recognition activity, resulting in impaired hematopoietic differentiation and myelodysplasia. Commonly occurring SRSF2 mutations impaired wildtype SRSF2s normal RNA-binding avidity and preference for specific exonic splicing enhancer RNA motifs. Integration of murine and human transcriptome data identified recurrent mis-splicing of key transcriptional regulators in the presence of mutant SRSF2, including promotion of a highly conserved poison exon of EZH2 that results in nonsense-mediated decay and contributes to impaired hematopoiesis. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the enrichment of specific mutations in spliceosomal proteins in myelodysplasia, and suggest that altered RNA recognition activity is a novel mechanism of leukemogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65349GSE65354	Cytosolic Hsp60 orchestrates the survival and inflammatory responses of vascular smooth muscle cells in injured aortic vessels by regulating NF-B-dependent gene expression	"Pro-inflammatory response of VSMCs is triggered by endothelial damage and a causative step for thrombosis and neointimal thickening in the arterial vessels. Therefore, we investigate a role of cytosolic Hsp60 as a novel pro-inflammatory mediator in VSMCs. Hsp60 was detected in the cytosol of VSMCs. The selective depletion of cytosolic Hsp60 in VSMCs reduced the IKK activation, repressed the induction of NF-B-dependent pro-survival genes (MnSOD and Bfl-1/A1), and enhanced apoptotic death in response to TNF-. Moreover, a quantitative RNA sequencing revealed that the expression of 75 genes among the 774 TNF--inducible genes was significantly reduced by the depletion of cytosolic Hsp60. In particular, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL20, and IL-6, was regulated by the cytosolic Hsp60 in VSMCs. Finally, the depletion of cytosolic Hsp60 markedly inhibited the neointimal thickening in the balloon-injured arterial vessels by inducing apoptotic cell death and inhibiting chemokine production.

We identified a direct pharmacologic NFkB inhibitor, PBS-1086, that suppressed this adaptive survival program and increased both the magnitude and duration of initial EGFR TKI response in cellular and in vivo tumor models, including a novel patient-derived NSCLC xenograft.

The healing potential of an injured ACL is known to decay over time. The molecular origin of this healing deficiency largely remains elusive but plausibly involves gene transcripts associated with tissue healing. To explore this possibility, we set out to identify transcript expression differences in injured ACL remnants recovered at the time of surgical reconstruction, via microarray (n=24) and RNA-seq (n=8) technologies in transcriptome profiling. We found that time-from-injury was an important determinant of changes in gene expression signatures predominately resulting in repression of several biological processes as identified by gene ontology. The most interesting observation was a time-dependent decline in the gene transcripts as well as the biological processes common to both microarray and RNA-seq analyses. Compared to acute tears, in chronic several important biological processes were namely extracellular matrix organization, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, wound healing, mesenchyme transition, and response to hypoxia. Furthermore, the cross-platform concordance in terms of differentially expressed transcripts or enriched pathways was linearly correlated (r=0.64). Microfluidic digital PCR confirmed the expression of selected differentially expressed transcripts. These intriguing findings suggest an initial attempt of the injured ACL to repair, which drops with time. These findings have implications for efforts to repair the ACL and may be relevant for its reconstruction. These findings also emphasize the utility of differentially expressed transcripts as prognostic biomarkers in patients with ACL injury."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65469GSE65473	Physical and functional CSL-p53 interactions underlie control of cancer stromal cell evolution [RNA-seq]	"Senescence of stromal fibroblasts has been linked to establishment of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) and aging-associated increase of tumors. However, in clinically occurring carcinomas, density and proliferation of CAFs are frequently increased rather than decreased. We previously showed that genetic deletion or down-modulation of the canonical Notch effector CSL/RBP-J in skin dermal fibroblasts is sufficient for CAF activation with consequent development of multifocal keratinocyte tumors. We now show that CSL deletion or knockdown induces senescence of primary fibroblasts derived from dermis, oral mucosa, breast and lung. CSL functions in these cells as a constitutive direct repressor of multiple senescence- and CAF-effector genes. At the same time, it physically interacts with p53, repressing its activity, and p53 activation provides a failsafe mechanism against compromised CSL function. Concomitant loss of CSL and p53 overcomes fibroblast senescence, enhances expression of CAF effector genes and, in vivo, promotes tumour and stromal cell expansion.

Although various consequences in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells have been attributed to FA-BMF, the quest to identify the initial pathological event is still ongoing. To address this issue, we established induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts of six FA patients with FANCA mutations. An improved reprogramming method yielded iPSC-like colonies from all patients, and iPSC clones were propagated from two patients. Quantitative evaluation of the differentiation ability demonstrated that the differentiation propensity toward the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages is already defective in early hemoangiogenic progenitors. The expression levels of critical transcription factors were significantly downregulated in these progenitors. These data indicate that the hematopoietic consequences in FA patients originate from the early hematopoietic stage, and highlight the potential usefulness of iPSC technology for elucidating the pathogenesis of FA-BMF."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65507GSE65508	Modeling the early phenotype at the neuromuscular junction of spinal muscular atrophy using patient-derived iPSCs (RNA-Seq)	"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations of the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene.

We generated NMJ-like structures using motor neurons (MNs) derived from SMA patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and found that the clustering of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is significantly impaired. Valproic acid and antisense oligonucleotide treatment ameliorated the AChR clustering defects, leading to an increase in the level of full-length SMN transcripts. Thus, the current in vitro model of AChR clustering using SMA patient-derived iPSCs is useful to dissect the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of SMA, and to evaluate the efficacy of new therapeutic approaches."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65508GSE65515	"Distinct epigenomes in CD4+ T cells of newborns, middle-ages and centenarians."

It is associated with improvements in metabolic and non metabolic co-morbidities which are thought to be mediated by a decrease of adipose tissue inflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these beneficial effects are poorly understood. We analyzed expression profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue from 22 obese women before and 3 months after surgery using the RNA-seq technology. Of 15,972 detected genes, 1214 were differentially expressed after surgery. Upregulated genes were mostly involved in the basal cellular machinery. Downregulated genes were enriched in metabolic functions of adipose tissue. At baseline, we identified 26 modules of coexpressed genes. The four most stable modules reflected the innate and adaptive immune responses of adipose tissue, including a general signature of innate immune cells, an adaptive immune response elicited by T lymphocytes, a neutrophil-mediated inflammatory signature and an interferon-signaling pathway, respectively. After surgery, a few crucial molecules involved in chemotaxis and activation of immune cells were disconnected from their respective networks.

To evaluate the degree of specificity and redundancy for these cytokines, we quantified global transcriptomic changes induced by the two cytokines and determined the relative contributions of STAT1 and STAT3 using genetic models and ChIP-seq. We found a high degree of overlap of the transcriptomes induced by IL-6 and IL-27 and extremely few examples in which the cytokines acted in opposition. Using STAT deficient cells and T cells from patients with gain-of-function STAT1 mutations, we show that STAT3 was responsible for the overall transcriptional output driven by both cytokines, whereas STAT1 was the driver of cytokine specificity. STAT1 did not compensate for the lack STAT3; on the contrary, much of STAT1 binding to chromatin was STAT3 dependent.

A better understanding of this process will aid the elucidation of mitochondrial disorders, in particular of the many genetically unsolved cases of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency. Yet, to date only few studies have investigated nuclear gene regulation in the context of OXPHOS deficiency. In this study, we combined RNA sequencing of human complex I-deficient patient cells across 32 conditions of perturbed mitochondrial metabolism, with a comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns, co-expression calculations and transcription factor binding sites. Results: Our analysis shows that OXPHOS genes have a significantly higher co-expression with each other than with other genes, including mitochondrial genes. We found no evidence for complex-specific mRNA expression regulation in the tested cell types and conditions: subunits of different OXPHOS complexes are similarly (co-)expressed and regulated by a common set of transcription factors. However, we did observe significant differences between the expression of OXPHOS complex subunits compared to assembly factors, suggesting divergent transcription programs. Furthermore, complex I co-expression calculations identified 684 genes with a likely role in OXPHOS biogenesis and function. Analysis of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of these genes revealed almost all known OXPHOS regulators (including GABP, NRF1/2, SP1, YY1, E-box factors) and a set of six yet uncharacterized candidate transcription factors (ELK1, KLF7, SP4, EHF, ZNF143, and EL2). Conclusions: OXPHOS genes share an expression program distinct from other mitochondrial genes, indicative of targeted regulation of this mitochondrial sub-process. Within the subset of OXPHOS genes we established a difference in expression between subunits and assembly factors. Most transcription regulators of genes that co-express with complex I are well-established factors for OXPHOS biogenesis. For the remaining six factors we here suggest for the first time a link with transcription regulation in OXPHOS deficiency."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65634GSE65644	SF3B1 association with chromatin determines splicing outcomes	"Much remains unknown concerning the mechanism by which the splicing machinery pinpoints short exons within intronic sequences and how splicing factors are directed to their pre-mRNA targets. Part of the explanation probably lies in differences in chromatin organization between exons and introns. Proteomic, co-immunoprecipitation, and sedimentation analyses described here indicated that SF3B1, an essential splicing component of the U2 snRNP complex, is strongly associated with nucleosomes. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses revealed that SF3B1 is specifically bound to nucleosomes located at exonic positions. SF3B1 binding is enriched at nucleosomes positioned over short exons flanked by long introns that are also characterized by differential GC content between exons and introns. Disruption of SF3B1 binding to such nucleosomes affected the splicing of these exons similarly to inhibition of SF3B1 expression. Our findings suggest that the association of SF3B1 with nucleosomes is functionally important for splice site recognition and that SF3B1 conveys splicing-relevant information embedded in chromatin structure."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65644GSE65683	Sperm RNA: A window to idiopathic infertile couples	"We examine how NGS sequencing of sperm can provide a window as to how particular perturbations of the sperm RNA profile from baseline may be indicative of male factor infertility, and may thus provide direction as to proper course of infertility treatment for couple."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65683GSE65705	Characterization of the platelet transcriptome by RNA sequencing in patients with acute myocardial infarction.	"Recent technological advances have made transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) possible in cells with low RNA copy number including platelets. Resulting studies have used RNA-seq in platelets isolated from healthy individuals to characterize the platelet transcriptome. However, platelets, possibly through gene expression changes, contribute to the etiology of and response to cardiovascular disease and events. To address this, we performed the largest human platelet RNA-seq analysis to date in 34 platelet samples: 16 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 16 non-STEMI (NSTEMI), and 2 controls."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65705GSE65761	Correction of human phospholamban R14del mutation associated with cardiomyopathy using targeted nucleases and combination therapy [RNA-Seq]	"Phospholamban R14del mutazion (PLN-R14del) has been identified in a large family pedigree in which heterozygous carriers exhibited inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and death by middle age. To better understand the causal link between the mutations in PLN and DCM pathology, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells from a DCM patient carrying the PLN R14del mutation. We showed that iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes recapitulated the DCM-specific phenotype and demonstrated that either TALEN-mediated genetic correction or combinatorial gene therapy resulted in phenotypic rescue. Our findings offer novel insights into the pathogenesis caused by mutant PLN and point to the development of potential new therapeutics of pathogenic genetic variants associated with inherited cardiomyopathies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65761GSE65778	The Small Molecule ISRIB Reverses the Effects of eIF2 Phosphorylation on Translation and Stress Granule Assembly	"We recently identified ISRIB as a potent inhibitor of the integrated stress response (ISR). ISRIB renders cells resistant to the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation and enhances long-term memory in rodents (10.7554/eLife.00498). Here we show by genome-wide in vivo ribosome profiling that translation of a restricted subset of mRNAs is induced upon ISR activation. ISRIB substantially reversed the translational effects elicited by phosphorylation of eIF2 and induced no major changes in translation or mRNA levels in unstressed cells. eIF2 phosphorylation-induced stress granule (SG) formation was blocked by ISRIB. Strikingly, ISRIB addition to stressed cells with pre-formed SGs induced their rapid disassembly, liberating mRNAs into the actively translating pool. Restoration of mRNA translation and modulation of SG dynamics may be an effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by eIF2 phosphorylation, SG formation and cognitive loss."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65778GSE65838	Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b associate with enhancers to regulate human epidermal stem cell homeostasis	"Here, we show that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b show non-overlapping and unique patterns of genomic localization in human epidermal stem cells and their differentiated counterparts. Dnmt3a, but not Dnmt3b, binds to the TSSs of a cohort of genes required for the interaction of stem cells with their underlying stroma. Unexpectedly, TSSs bound by Dnmt3a are highly transcribed and are devoid of DNA-methylation. Conversely, Dnmt3b specifically decorates the genebody of genes that establish the stem cell and differentiated signatures. Genic occupation by Dnmt3b correlates with high levels of DNA-methylation, broad domains of histone H3K4me3 8, and robust transcription. Intriguingly, both proteins also bind to the most active subset of enhancers, and are required for the production of their associated bidirectional enhancer RNAs 9. We show that typical and super-enhancers are very dynamically regulated during the linear transition of epidermal stem cells to differentiated keratinocytes. Interestingly, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b show a strong preference for the super-enhancers that define the ectodermal lineage, but importantly, that also establish the functional traits associated to the stem cell and differentiated states. These enhancers contain very low levels of DNA-methylation, but high amounts of DNA-hydroxymethylation.

Although variation in RNA levels, transcription factor binding and chromatin have been explored, little is known about global variation in translation and its genetic determinants among humans. We used ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry to perform an integrated analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a diverse group of individuals. We find significant differences in RNA levels, translation, and protein abundance suggesting diverse mechanisms of personalized gene expression control. Combined analysis of RNA expression and ribosome occupancy improves the identification of individual protein level differences. Finally, we identify genetic differences that specifically modulate ribosome occupancy - many of these differences lie close to start codons and upstream ORFs. Our results reveal a new level of gene expression variation among humans and indicate that genetic variants can cause changes in protein levels through effects on translation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65912GSE65926	"Circular RNAs in the mammalian brain are highly abundant, conserved, and dynamically expressed"	"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an endogenous class of animal RNAs.

Therefore, we sequenced RNA from different brain regions, primary neurons, isolated synapses, as well as during neuronal differentiation. Using these and other available data, we discovered and analyzed thousands of neuronal human and mouse circRNAs. circRNAs were extraordinarily enriched in the mammalian brain, well conserved in sequence, often expressed as circRNAs in both human and mouse, and sometimes even detected in Drosophila brains. circRNAs were overall upregulated during neuronal differentiation, highly enriched in synapses, and often differentially expressed compared to their mRNA isoforms. circRNA expression correlated negatively with expression of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1. Knockdown of ADAR1 induced elevated circRNA expression.

However, the molecular function of OXR1 is still unknown. Previously we showed that human OXR1 regulates expression of antioxidant genes GPX2 and HO-1 via the p21 signaling pathway. To examine the role of hOXR1 in global transcription regulation during cellular stress, we employed RNA sequencing to investigate the transcription profile in hOXR1 depleted HeLa cells. Methods: Control siRNA (siCon) and human OXR1 siRNA (siOXR1) transfected HeLa cells were either harvested directly (siCon_NT, siOXR1_NT) or exposed to 0.5 mM H2O2 for 1 h and then harvested immediately without recovery (siCon_R0h, siOXR1_R0h). Total RNA pooled from duplicate samples was used for RNA sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at gene level. The Blast2GO program was used to generate gene ontology (GO) annotation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).The WEGO software was used to further perform GO functional classification and to predict pathways affected. qRTPCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: In total, in non-treated and hydrogen peroxide exposed cells, hOXR1 depletion results in the down-regulation of 554 genes and the up-regulation of 253 genes. These differentially expressed genes include transcription factors (i.e. HIF1A, SP6, E2F8 and TCF3) and numerous genes of the p53 signaling pathway involved in cell-cycle arrest (i.e. cyclin D, CDK6 and p21) and apoptosis (i.e. CytC and CASP9). Western blot analysis reveals that hOXR1 suppresses CASP9 protein expression and reduces post-translational cleavage into its active form. After exposure to hydrogen peroxide (1 h), 56 early response genes were up-regulated in hOXR1 depleted cells, in which 38 of these genes were not induced in control cells. In addition, a subset of the commonly up-regulated early response genes showed a stronger induction in hOXR1 depleted cells (i.e. FOS, JUN and DUSP1). Out of a total of 52 differentially expressed transcription factors in hOXR1 depleted cells under normal physiology and oxidative stress condition, 14 genes (including HIF1A, STAT5A, E2F8 and TCF3) are differentially regulated under H2O2 treatment in hOXR1 silenced cells as compared to control cells. Finally, we demonstrate that hOXR1 depleted cells undergo cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase during oxidative stress. Conclusions: Human OXR1 is important for regulation of the early stress response to oxidative stress in HeLa cells. HOXR1 modulates the p53 signaling pathway via regulation of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and anti-oxidation. Further, hOXR1 regulates numerous transcription factors of importance for cellular stress responses. In summary, hOXR1 may act as a sensor of cellular oxidative stress to regulate the transcriptional networks required to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulate cell cycle arrest and cell death (apoptosis)."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65949GSE65991	Transcriptomic analysis of cultured corneal endothelial cells as a validation for their use in cell-replacement therapy	"The corneal endothelium plays a primary role in maintaining corneal homeostasis and clarity, and must be surgically replaced with allogenic donor corneal endothelium in the event of visually significant dysfunction. However, a worldwide shortage of donor corneal tissue has led to a search for alternative sources of transplantable tissue. Cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnC) have been shown to restore corneal clarity in experimental models of corneal endothelial dysfunction in animal models, but characterization of cultured HCEnC remains incomplete. To this end, we utilized next-generation RNA sequencing technology to compare the transcriptomic profile of ex vivo human corneal endothelium (evHCEnC) with that of primary HCEnC and HCEnC lines, and to determine the utility of cultured and immortalized corneal endothelial cells as models of in vivo corneal endothelium. Multidimensional analyses of the transcriptome datasets demonstrated that primary HCEnC have a closer relationship to evHCEnC than do immortalized HCEnC. Subsequent analyses showed that the majority of the genes specifically expressed in HCEnC (not expressed in ex vivo corneal epithelium or fibroblasts) demonstrated a marked variability of expression in cultured cells compared with evHCEnC. In addition, genes associated with either corneal endothelial cell function or corneal endothelial dystrophies were investigated. Significant differences in gene expression and protein levels were observed in the cultured cells compared with evHCEnC for each of the genes tested except for AGBL1 and LOXHD1, which were not detected by RNA-seq or qPCR. Our transcriptomic analysis suggests that at a molecular level primary HCEnC most closely resemble evHCEC and thus represent a viable therapeutic option for managing corneal endothelial dysfunction. Our findings also suggest that investigators should perform an assessment of the entire transcriptome of cultured HCEnC prior to determination of the potential clinical utility of the cultured HCEnC for the management of corneal endothelial cell failure."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65991GSE65996	"Comparative genome-wide analysis of human BM IL3R-high precursors show a more M-, DC- and OC committed gene expression profile, as compared to IL3R-low precursors"	"To clarify the lineage relationship between IL3Rhigh- and IL3Rlow precursor cells and to find potential molecules involved in their differentiation, we compared the IL3Rhigh- and IL3Rlow precursor populations from three independent donors by mRNA deep sequencing and used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)- and Multi-experimental Viewer (MeV) to analyze the differentially expressed genes (p<0.001). Analysis of the protein coding genes showed that the samples from IL3Rhigh precursor cells clustered together, as did the IL3Rlow samples. This indicated that the gene expression patterns of these cells are likely to be conserved. Further analysis revealed a list of (649) differentially expressed molecules between the two populations.

Recent studies indicate that some Alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles, and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mRNA degradation or translational efficiency. However, the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome remains unclear and controversial. The prevailing view is that exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as Alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins. We adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome. Using RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and proteomics data from human tissues and cell lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived peptides in human proteins. These Alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates. In the case of the RNA editing enzyme ADARB1, which contains an Alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, RNA sequencing analyses of A-to-I editing demonstrate that both the Alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active enzymes. The Alu exon derived peptide may fine tune the overall editing activity and, in limited cases, the site selectivity of ADARB1 protein products. Our data indicate that Alu elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences during primate and human evolution."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65999GSE66014	Global Gene Expression analysis of CUTLL1 cell lines after treatment with Perhexiline	"We identify perhexiline, a small molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, as a HES1-signature antagonist drug with robust antileukemic activity against NOTCH1 induced leukemias in vitro and in vivo."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66014GSE66053	Single mammalian cells compensate for differences in cellular volume and DNA copy number through independent global transcriptional mechanisms	We performed single-cell and bulk transcriptome profiling in two different human cell lines.

Little quantitative information exists as to either how many transcript copies of particular genes are m6A modified (m6A levels), or the relationship of m6A modification(s) to alternative RNA isoforms. To deconvolute the m6A epitranscriptome, we developed m6A level and isoform-characterization sequencing (m6A-LAIC-seq). We found that cells exhibit a broad range of non-stoichiometric m6A levels with cell type specificity. At the level of isoform characterization, we discovered widespread differences in use of tandem alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites by methylated and nonmethylated transcript isoforms of individual genes. Strikingly, there is a strong bias for methylated transcripts to be coupled with proximal APA sites, resulting in shortened 3 untranslated regions (3-UTRs), while nonmethylated transcript isoforms tend to use distal APA sites. m6A-LAIC-seq yields a new perspective on transcriptome complexity and links APA usage to m6A modifications."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66086GSE66117	Transcriptome analysis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)	"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a biologically and clinically heterogeneous disease. The somatic hypermutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes has been identified as one of the most robust prognostic markers in CLL. Patients with unmutated IGHV status (U-CLL) typically experience an inferior outcome compared to those whose clones express mutated IGHV genes (M-CLL). We conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in CD19+ B-cells from a group of 43 CLL patients using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Using base-pair resolution methylation sequencing, 2323 differentially methylated regions between CLL and normal B-cells (CLL-specific DMRs) and 569 between M-CLL and U-CLL samples (IGHV-specific DMRs) were identified in the CLL genomes. The IGHV-specific DMRs are mostly unique when compared to the CLL-specific DMRs. Less than 10%% of the IGHV-specific DMRs are located in promoter regions; however, more than half of these overlap with known DNase I hypersensitive sites, enhancer regions marked by histone modification (H3K4Me1 and H3K27Ac), and transcription factor binding sites in the ENCODE datasets, which indicates that these DMRs contain regulatory sequences. Distinctive DNA methylation patterns were observed in M-CLL and U-CLL samples. Overall, U-CLL was found to contain 50%% more hypermethylated regions than M-CLL samples. The hypermethylated loci observed in the U-CLL samples also appear to be hypermethylated in normal nave B-cells as compared memory B-cells, suggesting that M-CLL and U-CLL differ in differentiation status corresponding to normal B-cell differentiation stages. RNA-seq analysis performed using matched samples (n=34), in which both DNA methylation and gene expression data were available, demonstrated excellent correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression. Several genes whose expression status was previously shown to be associated with CLL prognosis such as ZAP70, CRY1, LDOC1, SEPT10, LAG3, and LPL were differentially methylated in the promoter regions between M-CLL and U-CLL samples indicating that DNA methylation plays an important role in defining the gene expression patterns of these prognostic genes. We further validated 9 genes with IGHV-specific DMRs in the promoter regions using bisulfite pyrosequencing, and the results demonstrated excellent correlation between differential methylation and IGHV mutation status. These novel differentially methylated genes could be developed into biomarkers for CLL prognosis. In addition, DNA hypomethylation was observed in a significant number of genes involved in lymphocyte activation such as PDCD1, NFAT1, and CD5. DNA hypomethylation was observed in the proximal promoter and far up-stream enhancer regions of CD5, an important cell surface marker that uniquely identifies CLL. Overall, the DNA methylation landscape in CLL patients indicates that CLL B cells possess an active B-cell phenotype; at the same time, U-CLL and M-CLL are faithfully committed to their lineage resembling either nave or memory B-cells. In summary, this comprehensive DNA methylation analysis has identified a large number of novel epigenetic changes in CLL patients. The results from this study will further advance our understanding of the epigenetic contribution to molecular subtypes in CLL."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66117GSE66148	"RNA Sequencing of default, melanocyte biased and enteric human neural crest populations (NC) and neuroectoderm (CNS)"	We have generated expression profiles of three different neural crest populations from human embryonic stem cells.

Recent studies highlighted an important role for NAF-1 in regulating autophagy via interaction with BCL-2. We recently reported that the level of NAF-1 is elevated in cancer cells and that NAF-1 is required for tumor growth. Here we report that shRNA suppression of NAF-1 results in the activation of apoptosis in xenograft tumors and cancer cells grown in culture. Suppression of NAF-1 resulted in a depletion in the cytosolic iron pool, facilitated uptake of iron, and accumulation of iron and ROS in mitochondria, a shift to glycolysis and glutaminolysis, and the activation of cellular stress pathways associated with HIF1, AMPK and mTOR. Suppression of NAF-1 in breast cancer cells appears therefore to reduce their tumorigenicity by interfering with cellular iron distribution and energy metabolism resulting in the activation of apoptosis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66158GSE66173	Genetic disruption of COX-1 inhibits multiple oncogenic pathways	"We performed RNA sequencing in isogenic models of COX-1 proficient (OV3/SCR) and COX-1 deficient (OV3/COX1KD) OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells.

Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a splicing factor required for the assembly and catalytic activity of the spliceosome. Core spliceosomal factors (SF3B1, U2AF1, and others) associate with BUD31 and are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total pre-mRNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity, and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66182GSE66207	mRNA and small RNA associated with Crohn's disease behavior [RNA-Seq]	"There is a need for reliable prognostic markers that can guide therapeutic intervention in Crohns disease (CD).

Specialized progenitors that are common in humans, but virtually absent in rodents, called outer radial glia (ORG), have been suggested to be crucial to the evolutionary expansion of the human cortex. We combined cell type-specific sorting with transcriptome-wide RNA-sequencing to identify genes enriched in human ORG, including targets of the transcription factor Neurogenin, and previously uncharacterized, evolutionarily dynamic, long noncoding RNAs. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of human, ferret, and mouse progenitors showed that more human RGC co-express proneural Neurogenin targets than in ferret or mouse, suggesting greater self-renewal of neuronal lineage-committed progenitors in humans. Finally, we show that activating the Neurogenin pathway in ferret RGC promotes delamination and outward migration. Thus, we find that the abundance of human ORG is paralleled by increased transcriptional heterogeneity of cortical progenitors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66217GSE66228	Immunoglobulin transcript sequence and somatic hypermutation computation from unselected RNA-seq reads in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	"IGHV mutation status is a well-established prognostic factor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and also provides crucial insights into tumor cell biology and function.

In this paper, we demonstrate that unselected next-generation RNA sequencing can accurately determine the IGH@ sequence, including the complete sequence of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), and mutation status of CLL cells, potentially replacing the current method which is a specialized, single-purpose Sanger-sequencing based test."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66228GSE66261	Expression and functions of long noncoding RNAs during human T helper cell differentiation	"To improve our understanding of lncRNA expression in T cells, we used whole genome sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify lncRNAs expressed in human T cells and those selectively expressed in T cells differentiated under TH1, TH2, or TH17 polarizing conditions. The majority of these lineage-specific lncRNAs are co-expressed with lineage-specific protein-coding genes. These lncRNAs are predominantly intragenic with co-expressed protein-coding genes and are transcribed in sense and antisense orientations with approximately equal frequencies. Further, genes encoding TH lineage specific mRNAs are not randomly distributed across the genome but are highly enriched in the genome in genomic regions also containing genes encoding TH lineage-specific lncRNAs. Our analyses also identify a cluster of antisense lncRNAs transcribed from the RAD50 locus that are selectively expressed under TH2 polarizing conditions and co-expressed with IL4, IL5 and IL13 genes. Depletion of these lncRNAs via selective siRNA treatment demonstrates the critical requirement of these lncRNAs for expression of the TH2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Collectively, our analyses identify new lncRNAs expressed in a TH lineage specific manner and identify a critical role for a cluster of lncRNAs for expression of genes encoding TH2 cytokines."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66261GSE66301	Gene expression profiling of patient's DCIS-IDC tandem lesions by RNA sequencing analysis	Tandem DCIS/IDC are defined as ductal carcicnoma in situ (DCIS) lesions that have concurrent invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) within the same breast.

The allogeneic mature moDC-expanded nTregs were fully characterized by analysis of the demethylation status within the TSDR of the FOXP3 gene and the expression of both protein and mRNA of FOXP3, HELIOS, CTLA4 and cytokines. In addition, the antigen-specific suppressive capacity of these expanded nTregs was tested. Results: Allogeneic mature moDC and skin-derived DC were superior in inducing nTreg-expansion compared to immature moDC or PBMC in an HLA-DR and CD80/CD86-dependent way. Remarkably, the presence of exogenous IL-15 without IL-2, could facilitate optimal mature moDC-induced nTreg-expansion. Allogeneic mature moDC-expanded nTregs were at low ratios (<1:320), potent suppressors of alloAg-induced proliferation without significant suppression of completely HLA-mismatched-Ag-induced proliferation. Mature moDC-expanded nTregs were highly demethylated at the TSDR within the FOXP3 gene and highly expressed of FOXP3, HELIOS and CTLA4. A minority of the expanded nTregs produced IL-10, IL-2, IFN-g and TNF-a but very few IL-17 producing nTregs were found. Next generation sequencing of mRNA of moDC-expanded nTregs revealed a strong induction of Treg-associated mRNAs. Conclusions: Human allogeneic mature moDC are highly efficient stimulator cells, in presence of exogenous IL-15, for expansion of stable alloAg-specific nTregs with superior suppressive function."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66385GSE66430	Expression of gallstone disease-associated genes in non-diseased and diseased gallbladder and liver samples	"Following a large-scale genome-wide association study of gallstone disease, we performed RNA sequencing from tissues of four human gallbladders (3 healthy controls and 1 case with chronic gallstones) and one liver sample from the gallstone case.

To study tissue mRNA expression changes induced by chronic elevated endogenous glucocorticoids, we performed RNA sequencing on subcutaneous adipose tissue from patients with Cushings disease (n=5) compared to patients with non-functioning pituitary adenomas (n=11). We found higher expression of transcripts involved in several metabolic pathways, including lipogenesis, proteolysis and glucose oxidation as well as decreased expression of transcripts involved in inflammation and protein synthesis. To further study this in a model system, we subjected mice to dexamethasone treatment for 12 weeks and analyzed their inguinal (subcutaneous) fat pads, which led to similar findings. Additionally, mice treated with dexamethasone showed drastic decreases in lean body mass as well as increased fat mass, further supporting the human transcriptomic data. These data provide insight to transcriptional changes that may be responsible for the co-morbidities associated with chronic elevations of glucocorticoids"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66446GSE66478	Biochemical fractionation of HEK293 nuclei and RNA-seq of chromatin-associated and soluble-nuclear RNA	Biochemical fractionation of HEK293 nuclei and RNA-seq of chromatin-associated and soluble-nuclear RNA.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66478GSE66506	Ectoderm specification of H1 human embryonic stem cells	"In recent years, several studies have shed light into the processes that regulate epidermal specification and homeostasis. We previously showed that a broad-spectrum secretase inhibitor DAPT promoted early keratinocyte specification in human embryonic stem cells triggered to undergo ectoderm specification. Here, we show that DAPT accelerates human embryonic stem cell differentiation and induces expression of the ectoderm protein AP2. Furthermore, we utilize RNA sequencing to identify several candidate regulators of ectoderm specification including those involved in epithelial and epidermal development in human embryonic stem cells. Genes associated with transcriptional regulation and growth factor activity are significantly enriched upon DAPT treatment during specification of human embryonic stem cells to the ectoderm lineage. The human ectoderm cell signature identified in this study contains several genes expressed in ectodermal and epithelial tissues. Importantly, these genes are also associated with skin disorders and ectodermal defects, providing a platform for understanding the biology of human epidermal keratinocyte development under diseased and homeostatic conditions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66506GSE66507	Single-Cell RNA-seq Defines the Three Cell Lineages of the Human Blastocyst	"Here we provide fundamental insights into early human development by single-cell RNA-sequencing of human and mouse preimplantation embryos. We elucidate conserved transcriptional programs along with those that are human-specific. Importantly, we validate our RNA-sequencing findings at the protein level, which further reveals differences in human and mouse embryo gene expression. For example, we identify several genes exclusively expressed in the human pluripotent epiblast including the transcription factor KLF17. Key components of the TGF- signaling pathway including NODAL, GDF3, TGFBR1/ALK5, LEFTY1, SMAD2, SMAD4 and TDGF1 are also enriched in the human epiblast. Intriguingly, inhibition of TGF- signaling abrogates NANOG expression in human epiblast cells, consistent with a requirement for this pathway in pluripotency. Although key trophectoderm factors Id2, Elf5, and Eomes are exclusively localized to this lineage in the mouse, the human orthologues are either absent or expressed in alternative lineages. Importantly, we also identify genes with conserved expression dynamics including Foxa2/FOXA2, which we show is restricted to the primitive endoderm in both human and mouse embryos. Comparisons of the human epiblast to existing embryonic stem cells (hESCs) reveals conservation of pluripotency but also additional pathways more enriched in hESCs. Our analysis highlights significant differences in human preimplantation development compared to mouse and provides a molecular blueprint to understand human embryogenesis and its relationship to stem cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66507GSE66539	Patient-derived xenograft platform for metastatic melanoma: a model for studying resistance to targeted therapy.	"The therapeutic landscape of melanoma is rapidly changing. While targeted inhibitors yield significant responses, their clinical benefit is often limited by the early onset of drug resistance. This motivates the pursuit to establish more durable clinical responses, by developing combinatorial therapies. But while potential new combinatorial targets steadily increase in numbers, they cannot possibly all be tested in patients. Similarly, while genetically engineered mouse melanoma models have great merit, they do not capture the enormous genetic diversity and heterogeneity typical in human melanoma. Furthermore, whereas in vitro studies have many advantages, they lack the presence of micro-environmental factors, which can have a profound impact on tumor progression and therapy response. This prompted us to develop an in vivo model for human melanoma that allows for studying the dynamics of tumor progression and drug response, with concurrent evaluation and optimization of new treatment regimens. Here, we present a collection of patient-derived xenografts (PDX), derived from BRAFV600E, NRASQ61 or BRAFWT/NRASWT melanoma metastases. The BRAFV600E PDX melanomas were acquired both prior to treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and after resistance had occurred, including six matched pairs. We find that PDX resemble their human donors melanomas regarding biomarkers, chromosomal aberrations, RNA expression profiles, mutational spectrum and targeted drug resistance patterns. Mutations, previously identified to cause resistance to BRAF inhibitors, are captured in PDX derived from resistant melanomThis melanoma PDX platform represents a comprehensive public resource to study both fundamental and translational aspects of melanoma progression and treatment in a physiologically relevant setting."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66539GSE66553	Identification of differentially spliced genes by wild type or S34F mutation of U2AF1	Identification of differentially spliced genes by wild type or S34F mutation of U2AF1	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66553GSE66556	Mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2) regulates metabolic adaptation and glucose-independent tumor cell growth	"Cancer cells must adapt metabolically to survive and proliferate when nutrients are limiting. Here we used combined transcriptional-metabolomic network analysis to identify metabolic pathways that support glucose-independent tumor cell growth. We found that glucose deprivation stimulated the re-wiring of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and co-opting early steps of gluconeogenesis to promote cell proliferation under low glucose. Glucose limitation promoted the production of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from glutamine, which was used to fuel biosynthetic pathways normally sustained by glucose, including serine and purine biosynthesis. Mitochondrial PEP-carboxykinase (PCK2) was required for this glutamine-dependent metabolic reprogramming. PCK2 expression was dependent on the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), and required to maintain tumor cell proliferation under limiting glucose availability. Elevated PCK2 expression is observed in several human tumor types, and enriched in tumor tissue from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Our results define a novel role for PCK2 in cancer cell metabolic reprogramming that promotes glucose-independent cell growth and metabolic stress resistance in human tumors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66556GSE66573	Defective structural RNA processing in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis	"It is fundamentally unknown how normal cellular processes or responses to extracellular stimuli may invoke polyadenylation and degradation of ncRNA substrates or if human disease processes exhibit defects in polyadenylation of ncRNA substrates as part of their pathogenesis. Our results demonstrate that mononuclear cells from subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) exhibit pervasive increases in levels of polyadenylated ncRNAs including Y1 RNA, 18S and 28S rRNA, and U1, U2, and U4 snRNAs and these defects are unique to RRMS. Defects in expression of both Ro60 and La proteins in RRMS appear to contribute to increased polyadenylation of ncRNAs. Further, IFN-1b, a common RRMS therapy, restores both Ro60 and La levels to normal as well as levels of polyadenylated Y1 RNA and U1 snRNA suggesting that aberrant polyadenylation of ncRNA substrates may have pathogenic consequences."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66573GSE66590	Multi-platform assessment of transcriptional profiling technologies utilizing a precise probe mapping methodology (RNA-seq_RiboZero)	"We present a more extensive and yet precise assessment to elucidate differences and similarities in performance at numerous aspects including signal range, sensitivity to fold-change, and fidelity with TaqMan qRT-PCR.

Accurate labeling of specific cell types is critical for determining the contribution of each to pathogenesis of these diseases. The distal lung alveolar epithelium is comprised of two cell types, alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) cells. While cell type-specific markers, most prominently surfactant protein C (SFTPC), have allowed detailed studies of AT2 cell differentiation and their roles in disease, studies of AT1 cells have been hampered by lack of genes with expression unique to AT1 cells. To address this, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of multiple rat organs alongside purified rat AT2, AT1 and in vitro differentiated AT1-like cells, resulting in identification of 54 candidate AT1 cell markers. Cross-referencing with genes upregulated in human in vitro differentiated AT1-like cells narrowed the potential list to 18 candidate genes. Testing the top four candidate genes at RNA and protein levels revealed GRAM domain 2 (GRAMD2), a protein of unknown function, as unique to AT1 cells, while SCNN1G within lung is restricted to AT1 cells. RNAseq confirmed that GRAMD2 is transcriptionally silent in human AT2 cells. Immunofluorescence of mouse alveoli verified that GRAMD2 expression is restricted to the plasma membrane of AT1 cells. These new AT1 cell-specific genes, with GRAMD2 as a leading candidate, will enhance AT1 cell isolation, investigation of alveolar epithelial cell differentiation potential, and contribution of AT1 cells to distal lung diseases."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66627GSE66719	SF3B1 Degron knockdown RNA-seq	"Knockdown of mutant and/or wild-type SF3B1 in MEL202 cell line by Degron knock-in, followed by RNA-seq, to identify splicing events governed by mutant SF3B1."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66719GSE66742	Epigenome Editing by a CRISPR/Cas9-Based Acetyltransferase Activates Genes from Promoters and Enhancers	"Epigenetic modifications determine the structure and regulation of eukaryotic genomes and define key signatures of cell lineage specification. Technologies that facilitate the targeted manipulation of epigenetic marks could be used to precisely control cell phenotype or interrogate the relationship between the epigenome and transcriptional control. Here we have generated a programmable acetyltransferase based on the CRISPR/Cas9 gene regulation system, consisting of the nuclease-null dCas9 protein fused to the catalytic core of the human acetyltransferase p300. This fusion protein catalyzes acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) at its target sites, leading to robust transcriptional activation of target genes from promoters, proximal enhancers, and distal enhancers. In contrast to conventional dCas9-based activators, the acetyltransferase fusion effectively activated genes from enhancer regions and with individual guide RNAs. The core p300 domain was also portable to other programmable DNA-binding proteins. This technology enables the targeted perturbation of native epigenetic architecture and will be useful for reprogramming the epigenome for applications in genomics, genetics, disease modeling, and manipulating cell fate."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66742GSE66744	Decoding breast cancer tissue-stroma interactions using species-specific sequencing	"Decoding genome-wide effects of experimental tissue-tissue or cell-cell interactions is important, for example, to better understand tumor-stroma interactions after transplantation (xenografting). Transcriptome analysis of intermixed human and mouse cells has frequently relied on the need to separate the two cell populations prior to transcriptome analysis, which introduces confounding effects on gene expression. To circumvent this problem, we perform a bioinformatics-based genome-wide transcriptome analysis technique separating the mouse and human transcriptome part of a dataset, which allows a mixed mouse and human cell population to be sequenced without prior cell sorting. We use the new technology  which we call S3 (S-cube for Species-specific sequencing) technology  to provide new insights into the Notch downstream response following Notch ligand-stimulation and to explore transcriptional changes following transplantation of luminal (MCF7) and basal-type (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cells into mammary fat pad tissue in mice."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66744GSE66755	CRISPR Display: A modular method for locus-specific targeting of long noncoding RNAs and synthetic RNA devices in vivo [RNA-Seq]	"Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) comprise an important class of natural regulators that mediate a vast array of biological processes, including the modulation of chromatin architecture. Moreover, artificial ncRNAs have revealed that the functional capabilities of RNA are extremely broad. To further investigate and harness these capabilities, we developed CRISPR-Display ('CRISP-Disp'), a targeted localization strategy that uses Cas9 to deploy large RNA cargos to specific DNA loci. We demonstrate that exogenous RNA domains can be functionally appended onto the CRISPR scaffold at multiple insertion points, allowing the construction of Cas9 complexes with RNAs nearing one kilobase in length, with structured RNAs, protein-binding cassettes, artificial aptamers and pools of random sequences. CRISP-Disp also allows the simultaneous multiplexing of disparate functions at multiple targets.

A total of 13,324 T cell libraries generated from blood of 23 patients and 22 healthy controls were interrogated for reactivity to myelin antigens. Libraries derived from CCR6+ myelin-reactive T cells from patients with MS exhibited significantly enhanced production of IFN-, IL-17, and GM-CSF compared to healthy controls. Single-cell clones isolated by MHC/peptide tetramers from CCR6+ T cell libraries also secreted more pro-inflammatory cytokines while clones isolated from controls secreted more IL-10. The transcriptomes of myelin-specific CCR6+ T cells from patients with MS were distinct from those derived from healthy controls, and of note, were enriched in Th17-induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) gene signatures and gene signatures derived from Th17 cells isolated other human autoimmune diseases. These data, although not casual, imply that functional differences between antigen specific T cells from MS and healthy controls is fundamental to disease development and support the notion that IL-10 production from myelin-reactive T cells may act to limit disease progression, or even pathogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66763GSE66767	Epoxyeicosatrienoic Acids Enhance Haematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Specification and Engraftment	"Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplant is a widely used treatment for life-threatening conditions including leukemia; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating HSPC engraftment of the recipient niche remain incompletely understood. Here, we developed a competitive HSPC transplant method in adult zebrafish, using in vivo imaging as a non-invasive readout. We used this system to conduct a chemical screen and identified epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) as a family of lipids that enhance HSPC engraftment. EETs pro-haematopoietic effects are conserved in the developing zebrafish, where this molecule promotes HSPC specification through activating a unique AP-1/runx1 transcription program autonomous to the haemogenic endothelium. This effect requires the activation of PI3K pathway, specifically PI3Kg. In adult HSPCs, EETs induce transcriptional programs including AP-1 activation, modulating multiple cellular processes, such as migration, to promote engraftment. Finally, we demonstrated that the EET effects on enhancing HSPC homing and engraftment are conserved in mammals. Our study established a novel method to explore the molecular mechanisms of HSPC engraftment, and discovered a previously unrecognized, evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating multiple haematopoietic generation and regeneration processes. EETs may have clinical application in marrow or cord blood transplantation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66767GSE66769	Discovery of novel isoforms of Huntingtin reveals a new hominid-specific exon	"Huntingtons disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder that is caused by an expansion of the poly-Q tract in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene (HTT). HTT is an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein that has been linked to a variety of functions including transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial function, and vesicle transport. This large protein has numerous caspase and calpain cleavage sites and can be decorated with several post-translational modifications such as phosphorylations, acetylations, sumoylations, and palmitoylations. However, the exact function of HTT and the role played by its modifications in the cell is still not well understood. Scrutiny of HTT function has been focused on a single, full length, mRNA. In this study, we report the discovery of 5 novel HTT mRNA splice isoforms that are expressed in normal and HD-hESC lines as well as cortical neurons differentiated from hESCs. Interestingly, none of the novel isoforms generates a truncated protein. Instead, 4 of the 5 new isoforms specifically eliminate domains and modifications to generate smaller HTT proteins. The fifth novel isoform incorporates a previously unreported additional exon, dubbed 41b, which is hominid-specific and introduces a potential phosphorylation site in the protein. The discovery of this hominid-specific isoform may shed light on human-specific pathogenic mechanisms of HTT, which could not be investigated with current mouse models of the disease.

However, It is not known whether a specific mitotic factor plays a critical role in reprogramming. Here we identify an isoform of human bromodomain-containing 3 (BRD3), BRD3R (BRD3 with Reprogramming activity), as a reprogramming factor. BRD3R positively regulates mitosis during reprogramming, upregulates a large set of mitotic genes at early stages of reprogramming, and associates with mitotic chromatin. Interestingly, a set of the mitotic genes upregulated by BRD3R constitutes a pluripotent molecular signature. The two BRD3 isoforms display differential binding to acetylated histones. Our results suggest a molecular interpretation for the mitotic advantage in reprogramming, and show that mitosis may be a driving force of reprogramming."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66798GSE66809	"IFN-g Regulates mTORC1, Cellular Metabolism and mRNA Translation to Potentiate Inflammatory Macrophage Activation [RNA-Seq]"	"IFN-g primes macrophages for enhanced inflammatory activation by TLRs and microbial killing, but little is known about the regulation of cell metabolism or mRNA translation during priming. We found that IFN-g regulates macrophage metabolism and translation in an integrated manner by targeting mTORC1 and MNK pathways that converge on the selective regulator of translation initiation eIF4E. Physiological downregulation of the central metabolic regulator mTORC1 by IFN-g was associated with autophagy and translational suppression of repressors of inflammation such as HES1. Genome-wide ribosome profiling in TLR2-stimulated macrophages revealed that IFN-g selectively modulates the macrophage translatome to promote inflammation, further reprogram metabolic pathways, and modulate protein synthesis.

We hypothesized that intercellular communication is critical for metastatic progression. Here, we show that PC-derived exosomes induce liver pre-metastatic niche formation in nave mice and consequently increase liver metastatic burden. Uptake of PC-derived exosomes by Kupffer cells caused transforming growth factor  secretion and upregulation of fibronectin production by hepatic stellate cells. This fibrotic microenvironment enhanced recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was highly expressed in PC-derived exosomes, and its blockade prevented liver pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. Compared to patients whose pancreatic tumors did not progress, MIF was markedly higher in exosomes from stage I PC patients who later developed liver metastasis. These findings suggest that exosomal MIF primes the liver for metastasis and may be a prognostic marker for the development of PC liver metastasis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66876GSE66879	RNA sequencing of SETD2 isogenic renal cell carcinoma cell lines	RNA sequencing of SETD2 isogenic renal cell carcinoma cell lines.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66879GSE66895	Disease-Associated SNPs From non-Coding Regions in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Are Located Within or Adjacent to Functional Genomic Elements of Human Neutrophils and CD4+ T Cells [RNA-Seq]	We sequenced mRNA from 3 neutrophil cells taken from 3 male adult to generate the gene expression profile of human neutrophil cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66895GSE66917	Leucegene: AML sequencing (part 4)	RNA sequencing of human leukemia	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66917GSE66927	Ribo_seq (aka ribosome profiling) analysis of control and Myc-induced U2OS cells	"We used Ribo-seq to examine the effect of Myc activation on protein translation in U2OS cells and correalted these changes with alterations in RNA level measured by RNA-seq on tye same conditions.

However, the specific roles of lncRNAs in this circuitry are poorly understood. Here, we determined that growth-arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5), which is a known tumor suppressor and growth arrest gene, is abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm of hESCs and essential for hESC self-renewal. GAS5 depletion in hESCs significantly impaired their pluripotency and self-renewal ability, whereas GAS5 overexpression in hESCs accelerated the cell cycle, enhanced their colony formation ability and increased pluripotency marker expression. By RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we determined that GAS5 activates NODAL-SMAD2/3 signaling by sustaining the expression of NODAL, which plays a key role in hESC self-renewal but not in somatic cell growth. Further studies indicated that GAS5 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to protect NODAL mRNA against degradation and that GAS5 transcription is directly controlled by the core pluripotency transcriptional factors (TFs). Taken together, we suggest that the core TFs, GAS5 and NODAL-SMAD2/3 form a feed-forward loop to maintain the hESC self-renewal process. These findings are specific to ESCs and did not occur in the somatic cell lines we tested; therefore, our findings also provide evidence that the functions of lncRNAs vary in different biological contexts."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66993GSE67039	Leucegene: AML sequencing (part 5)	RNA sequencing of human leukemia	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67039GSE67070	Stem cell and neurogenic gene-expression profiles link prostate basal cells to aggressive prostate cancer	"The prostate gland mainly contains basal and luminal cells constructed as a pseudostratified epithelium. Annotation of prostate epithelial transcriptomes provides a foundation for discoveries that can impact disease understanding and treatment. Here, we describe a whole-genome transcriptome analysis of human benign prostatic basal and luminal populations by using deep RNA sequencing. Combined with comprehensive molecular and biological characterizations, we show that the differential gene expression profiles account for their distinct functional phenotypes. Strikingly, in contrast to luminal cells, basal cells preferentially express gene categories associated with stem cells, neural and neuronal development and RNA processing. Consistent with their expression profiles, basal cells functionally exhibit intrinsic stem-like and proneural properties with enhanced ribosome RNA (rRNA) transcription activity. Of clinical relevance, the treatment failed castration-resistant and anaplastic prostate cancers molecularly resemble a basal-like phenotype.

Periodontitis also sustains a chronic long-term pro-inflammatory immune disorder, potentially contributing to other systemic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and osteoporosis. However, the role of P. gingivalis minor and major fimbriae in DC-SIGN-TLR2 crosstalk during traverses from oral mucosa to these distant sites and its influence on survival of P. gingivalis within DCs and its immune-mechanism involve at molecular/transcriptome level has not been examined. In this study to address the role of fimbriae we utilized defined bacterial mutants that solely express minor fimbriae (Mfa1+Pg), major fimbriae (FimA+Pg) or are deficient in both fimbriae (MFB) and compared with un-infected control. P. gingivalis strains were maintained anaerobically (10%% H2, 10%% CO2, and 80%% N2) in a Forma Scientific anaerobic system glove box model 1025/1029 at 37C in Difco anaerobe broth MIC. Mutant strains were maintained using erythromycin (5 g/ml) for mutant Mfa1+Pg, tetracycline (2 g/ml) for mutant FimA+Pg and both erythromycin and tetracycline for double fimbriae mutant MFB. Bacterial suspensions were washed five times in PBS and re-suspended for spectrophotometer reading at OD 660 nm of 0.11, which previously determined to be equal to 5 x 107 CFU. For bacterial CFSE staining, the suspension were washed (3 times) and re-suspended in 5 M of CFSE in PBS. The bacteria were incubated for 30 min at 37C in the dark.

We report extensive alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) defects in the cerebellum of c9ALS cases (8,224 AS, 1,437 APA), including changes in ALS-associated genes (e.g. ATXN2 and FUS), and cases of sporadic ALS (sALS; 2,229 AS, 716 APA).

In clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC) HIF pathways are upregulated by inactivation of the von-Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor. However HIF-1a and HIF-2a have contrasting effects on experimental tumour progression. To better understand this paradox we examined pan-genomic patterns of HIF DNA binding and associated gene expression in response to manipulation of HIF-1a and HIF-2a and related the findings to CCRC prognosis. Our findings reveal distinct pan-genomic organization of HIF isoform-specific DNA binding at thousands of sites. Overall associations were observed between HIF-1a-specific binding, and genes associated with favourable prognosis and between HIF-2a-specific binding and adverse prognosis. However within each isoform-specific set, individual gene associations were heterogeneous in sign and magnitude, suggesting that activation of each HIF-a isoform contributes a highly complex mix of pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67237GSE67240	Study the effect of SUZ12 on the responsiveness of IFNg target genes in multiple cancer and non cancer cell lines	We studied the effect of knocking down SUZ12 on the responsiveness of IFNg target genes	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67240GSE67250	Integration of genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome of human intestinal fibroblasts reveals novel candidate gene signatures in Crohns disease-associated fibrosis	"Tissue fibrosis is a serious complication of Crohns disease (CD) as well as of a variety of other complex, chronic pathologies. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of tissue fibrosis is crucial for the development of tissue-specific prevention and interventional treatment strategies. To identify molecular states specific to fibrotic disease, we employed deep sequencing to define the genome-wide DNA methylome and the whole transcriptome of purified human intestinal fibrotic fibroblasts (HIFs) isolated from the colon of patients with fibrotic CD. Integration of this information, via computational tools, identified candidate molecular interactions that could lead to fibrosis pathology.

Using the epidermis as a model, we show here that the BAF chromatin remodeling complex is essential to maintain a subset of open chromatin regions, which are strikingly enriched for the DNA binding motif of the stratified epithelial lineage-determining transcription factor p63 (p=1X10-1786). These p63 sites are intrinsically inaccessible. BAF is required to displace nucleosomes ~40 base pairs away from p63 motifs to enable p63 binding, to maintain active histone marks, and to recruit RNA polymerase II to promote gene expression. In this process, p63 was itself also essential for full BAF recruitment to p63 binding sites. Intrinsically, p63 binding sequences favor nucleosome occupancy. Our data therefore suggest a model where a lineage-specific transcription factor cooperates with the BAF complex to establish genome accessibility and engage tissue-specific gene expression."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67382GSE67427	Mycobacterial infection induces a specific human innate immune response	"The innate immune system provides the first response to pathogen infection and orchestrates the activation of the adaptive immune system. Though a large component of the innate immune response is common to all infections, pathogen-specific innate immune responses have been documented as well. The innate immune response is thought to be especially critical for fighting infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). While TB can be a deadly disease, only 5-10%% of individuals infected with MTB develop active disease, and this inter-individual variation is, at least partly, heritable. Studies of inter-individual variation in the innate immune response to MTB infection may therefore shed light on the genetic basis for variation in susceptibility to TB. Yet, to date, we still do not know which properties of the innate immune response are specific to MTB infection and which represent a general response to pathogen infection. To begin addressing this gap, we infected macrophages with eight different bacterial pathogens, including different MTB strains and related mycobacteria, and studied the transcriptional response to infection. We found that although the gene expression changes were largely consistent across the bacterial infection treatments, we were able to identify a novel subset of genes whose regulation was affected specifically by infection with mycobacteria. Genetic variants that are associated with regulatory differences in these genes should be considered candidate loci for explaining inter-individual susceptibility TB."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67427GSE67447	The MEF2B Regulatory Network - RNA-seq data	"Myocyte enhancer factor 2B (MEF2B) is a transcription factor with somatic mutation hotspots at K4, Y69 and D83 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). The recurrence of these mutations indicates that they may drive lymphoma development. However, inferring the mechanisms by which they may drive lymphoma development was complicated by our limited understanding of MEF2Bs normal functions. To expand our understanding of the cellular activities of wildtype (WT) and mutant MEF2B, I developed and addressed two hypotheses: (1) identifying genes regulated by WT MEF2B will allow identification of cellular phenotypes affected by MEF2B activity and (2) contrasting the DNA binding sites, effects on gene expression and effects on cellular phenotypes of mutant and WT MEF2B will help refine hypotheses about how MEF2B mutations may contribute to lymphoma development. To address these hypotheses, I first identified genome-wide WT MEF2B binding sites and transcriptome-wide gene expression changes mediated by WT MEF2B. Using these data I identified and validated novel MEF2B target genes. I found that target genes of MEF2B included the cancer genes MYC, TGFB1, CARD11, NDRG1, RHOB, BCL2 and JUN. Identification of target genes led to findings that WT MEF2B promotes expression of mesenchymal markers, promotes HEK293A cell migration, and inhibits DLBCL cell chemotaxis. I then investigated how K4E, Y69H and D83V mutations change MEF2Bs activity. I found that K4E, Y69H and D83V mutations decreased MEF2B DNA binding and decreased MEF2Bs capacity to promote gene expression in both HEK293A and DLBCL cells. These mutations also reduced MEF2Bs capacity to alter HEK293A and DLBCL cell movement. From these data, I hypothesize that MEF2B mutations may promote DLBCL and FL development by reducing expression of MEF2B target genes that would otherwise function to help confine germinal centre B-cells to germinal centres. Overall, my research demonstrates how observations from genome-scale data can be used to identify cellular effects of candidate driver mutations. Moreover, my work provides a unique resource for exploring the role of MEF2B in cell biology: I map for the first time the MEF2B regulome, demonstrating connections between a relatively understudied transcription factor and genes significant to oncogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67447GSE67488	Omic Personality: Implications of Stable Transcript and Methylation Profiles for Personalized Medicine [RNA-Seq]	"Background: Personalized medicine is predicated on the notion that individual biochemical and genomic profiles are relatively constant in times of good health and to some extent predictive of disease or therapeutic response. We report a pilot study quantifying gene expression and methylation profile consistency over time, addressing the reasons for individual uniqueness, and its relation to N=1 phenotypes. Methods: Whole blood samples from 4 African American women, 4 Caucasian women, and 4 Caucasian men drawn from the Atlanta Center for Health Discovery and Well Being study at three successive 6-month intervals were profiled by RNASeq, miRNASeq, and Illumina Methyl-450 arrays. Standard regression approaches were used to evaluate the proportion of variance for each type of omic measure that is among individuals, and to quantify correlations among measures and with clinical attributes related to wellness. Results: Longitudinal omic profiles are in general highly consistent over time, with an average of 67%% of the variance in transcript abundance, 42%% of CpG methylation level (but 88%% for the most differentiated CpG per gene), and 50%% of miRNA abundance among individuals, which are all comparable to 74%% of the variance among individuals for 74 clinical traits. One third of the variance can be attributed to differential blood cell type abundance, which is also fairly stable over time, and a lesser amount to eQTL effects, whereas seven conserved axes of covariance that capture diverse aspects of immune function explain over half of the variance. These axes also explain a considerable proportion of individually extreme transcript abundance, namely approximately 100 genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated in each person and are in some cases enriched for relevant gene activities that plausibly associate with clinical attributes. A similar fraction of genes have individually divergent methylation levels, but these do not overlap with the transcripts, and fewer than 20%% of genes have significantly correlated methylation and gene expression. Conclusions: People express an omic personality consisting of peripheral blood transcriptional and epigenetic profiles that are constant over the course of a year and reflect various types of immune activity. Baseline genomic profiles can provide a window into the molecular basis of traits that might be useful for explaining medical conditions or guiding personalized health decisions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67488GSE67519	Genome-wide mapping of TEL-AML1 targets in acute leukemia	"Around 20-25%% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias carry the TEL-AML1 (TA) fusion gene.

We observed that human islet composition was not influenced by age, gender, or body mass index and transcripts for inflammatory gene products were noted in fetal b cells. In addition, within highly purified adult glucagon-expressing a cells, we observed surprisingly high insulin mRNA expression, but not insulin protein expression.

RNA and small RNA extracted and sent for sequencing. Approximately 50 million read fragments mapped to the transcriptome using STAR aligner to hg19 and fragments counted with htseq. EdgeR was used to quantify the differences between treatment groups. There were significant changes upon knocking down PITX2c or PANCR in the RNA sequencing with high concordance of effect sizes between the two treatments (r2 = 0.85). Similar to the RNAseq analysis, this miRNAseq analysis shows that the effects of PANCR knockdown on miRNA expression may be largely mediated by through its effect on PITX2c expression.

For long term survival of engrafting cells in the body, not only do the cells have to execute liverspecific function but also withstand the physical strains and invading pathogens. The cellular innate immune system orchestrated by the interferon (IFN) pathway provides the first line of defense against pathogens. The objective of this study is to assess the innate immune function as well as to systematically profile the IFN-induced genes during hepatic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. To address this objective, we derived endodermal cells (day 5 postdifferentiation), hepatoblast (day 15) and immature hepatocytes (day 21) from human embryonic stem cells (hESC). Day 5, 15 and 21 cells were stimulated with IFN- and subjected to IFN pathway analysis. Transcriptome analysis was carried out by RNA sequencing. The results showed that the IFN- treatment activated STAT-JAK pathway in differentiating cells. Transcriptome analysis indicated stage specific expression of classical and non-classical IFNstimulated genes (ISGs). Subsequent validation confirmed the expression of novel ISGs including RASGRP3, CLMP and TRANK1 by differentiated hepatocytes upon IFN treatment. Hepatitis C virus replication in hESC-derived hepatic cells induced the expression of ISGs  LAMP3, ETV7, RASGRP3, and TRANK1. The hESC-derived hepatic cells contain intact innate system and can recognize invading pathogens. Besides assessing the tissue-specific functions for cell therapy applications, it may also be important to test the innate immune function of engrafting cells to ensure adequate defense against infections and improve graft survival."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67848GSE67892	CTCF and CohesinSA-1 Mark Active Promoters and Boundaries of Repressive Chromatin Domains in Primary Human Erythroid Cells [RNA-Seq]	"CTCF and cohesinSA-1 are regulatory proteins involved in a number of critical cellular processes including transcription, maintenance of chromatin domain architecture, and insulator function. To assess changes in the CTCF and cohesinSA-1 interactomes during erythropoiesis, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high throughput sequencing and mRNA transcriptome analyses via RNA-seq were performed in primary human HSPC hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and primary human erythroid cells from single donors. Sites of CTCF and cohesinSA-1 co-occupancy were enriched in gene promoters in HSPC and erythroid cells compared to single CTCF or cohesin sites. Cell type-specific CTCF sites in erythroid cells were linked to highly expressed genes, with the opposite pattern observed in HSPCs. Chromatin domains were identified by ChIP-seq with antibodies against trimethylated lysine 27 histone 3, a modification associated with repressive chromatin. Repressive chromatin domains increased in both number and size during hematopoiesis, with many more repressive domains in erythroid cells than HSPCs. CTCF and cohesinSA-1 marked the boundaries of these repressive chromatin domains in a cell-type specific manner. These genomic data support the hypothesis that CTCF and cohesinSA-1 have multiple roles in the regulation of gene expression during erythropoiesis including transcriptional regulation at gene promoters and maintenance of chromatin architecture."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67892GSE67902	Regulation of protein translation during mitosis	"Entry into and exit from mitosis is driven by precisely-timed changes in protein abundance, and involves transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. However, the role of translational regulation in modulating cellular protein content during mitosis remains poorly understood. Here, using ribosome profiling, we show that translational, rather than transcriptional regulation is the dominant mechanism for modulating protein synthesis at mitotic entry. The vast majority of regulated mRNAs are translationally repressed, which contrasts previous findings of selective mRNA translational activation at mitotic entry. One of the most pronounced translationally repressed genes in mitosis is Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex (APC), which is degraded during mitosis. We show that Emi1 degradation is insufficient for full APC activation and that simultaneous translational repression is required.

We found that transcriptome changes during early reprogramming occur independently from the opening of closed chromatin by OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC (OSKM). Furthermore, our data identify multiple spliced forms of genes uniquely expressed at each progressive stage of reprogramming. In particular, we found a pluripotency-specific spliced form of CCNE1 that significantly enhances reprogramming.

To identify sequence and structural features influencing this choice, we determined cleavage efficiencies of >50,000 variants of three human pri-miRNAs, focusing on the regions intractable to previous high-throughput analyses. Our analyses revealed a mismatched motif in the basal stem region, a preference for maintaining or improving base-pairing throughout the remainder of the stem, and a narrow stem-length preference of 351 base pairs. Incorporating these features with previously identified features, including three primary-sequence motifs, yielded a unifying model defining mammalian pri-miRNAs, in which motifs help orient processing and increase efficiency, with the presence of more motifs compensating for structural defects.

Knockdown of HEXIM1 rescues neural crest and melanoma nucleotide stress phenotypes in vivo. Mechanistically, under nucleotide stress, HEXIM1 is induced to form an inhibitory complex with P-TEFb, the kinase that initiates transcription elongation, to pause transcription at tumorigenic genes.

We used directional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the lncRNAs expressed in human HSCs. We also identified the lncRNAs that change in expression with differentiation of nonfibrotic quiescent HSCs into fibrotic HSC myofibroblasts and those that are regulated by TGF-beta signaling. ChIP-seq was also performed to identify DNA regions occupied by H3K27ac to define super-enhancers in HSC myofibroblasts.

Our aim was to compare AF transcriptomic profiles at different time points in pregnancy to demonstrate unique genetic signatures that would serve as potential biomarkers indicative of fetal maturation. Methods: We isolated AF RNA from 16 women at different time points in pregnancy: 4 from 18-24 weeks, 6 from 34-36 weeks, and 6 from at 39-40 weeks. RNA-sequencing was performed on cell-free RNA. Gene expression and splicing analyses were performed in conjunction with cell-type and pathway inference. Results: Sample-level analysis at different time points in pregnancy yielded a strong correlation with cell types found in the intrauterine environment and fetal respiratory, digestive and external barrier tissues of the fetus, using high-confidence cellular molecular markers. While some genes and splice variants were present throughout pregnancy, an abundant number of transcripts were uniquely expressed at different time points in pregnancy and associated with distinct fetal co-morbidities (respiratory distress and gavage feeding), indicating fetal immaturity. Conclusions: The AF transcriptome exhibits unique cell- and organ-selective expression patterns at different time points in pregnancy that can potentially identify fetal organ maturity and predict neonatal morbidity. Developing novel biomarkers indicative of the maturation of multiple organ systems can improve upon our current methods of fetal maturity testing which focus solely on the lung, and better inform obstetrical decisions regarding delivery timing."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68180GSE68219	MYC is a major determinant of mitotic cell fate	"Purpose: To determine global gene expression changes following siRNA knockdown of Myc, Kcnk1, and Snta1 compared to non-targeting siRNAs or mock-transfected cells Methods: Total RNA was processed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit according to manufacturers protocol. Generated cDNA libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer with four biological replicates sequenced per condition using single read, 50 cycle runs. Quality of sequencing reads were assessed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics) and then aligned to a reference genome (hg19, UCSC Genome Browser) using TopHat. Sequencing yielded, on average, 23.7 million unique reads per sample with a 60.7 - 65.7%% mapping rate. Cufflinks was used to generate transcript abundance for each annotated protein-coding gene as Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM), and statistical analysis and comparison of FPKM values was calculated using R (Bioconductor). Results: Fold changes comparing mock and a non-targeting siRNA were highly congruent. Myc RNAi induced numerous changes, with 955 downregulated genes and 1214 upregulated genes. The effect on Myc itself was relatively modest, possibly reflecting its ability to negatively auto-regulate its own expression. Gene ontology analysis highlighted ribosome biogenesis, metabolism, gene expression, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways, consistent with known Myc functions. The Kcnk1 siRNA affected 424 genes, with KCNK1 itself one of the most repressed. While gene ontology analysis also highlighted metabolism and biosynthesis pathways, the p-values and fold enrichment scores were substantially lower, indicating that DiM can be suppressed without major effects on metabolism and biosynthesis pathways. The Snta1 siRNA deregulated 575 genes, with SNTA1 itself the most repressed gene. Cell cycle and mitosis-related gene ontology terms feature heavily, consistent with this siRNA accelerating mitotic exit. Interestingly, FoxM1, which drives G2/M gene expression was reduced 1.75-fold, indicating that this siRNA may disrupt mitotic controls by deregulating FoxM1.

While both H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 are highly expressed in metastatic melanoma and correlate with decreased patient survival, only H2A.Z.2 deficiency results in impaired cellular proliferation of melanoma cells, which occurs via a G1/S arrest. Integrated gene expression and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that H2A.Z.2 positively regulates E2F target genes, and that such genes acquire a distinct H2A.Z occupancy signature over the promoter and gene body in metastatic melanoma cells. We further identified the BET family member BRD2 as an H2A.Z-interacting protein in melanoma cells, and demonstrate that H2A.Z.2 silencing cooperates with BET inhibition to induce cell death."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68221GSE68228	Alternative splicing in genes encoding adhesion- and motility-related proteins in breast cancer	"In this study, combining 1) RNA-Sequencing on MCF-7 cell line, 2) a new computational approach to identify splice isoforms and 3) an extensive experimental validation (in vitro - on MCF-10, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231  and ex vivo  on human breast cancer tissues) we investigated simultaneously gene expression and alternative splicing in genes encoding for adhesion and motility-related molecules-, including Semaphorins and their receptors and co-receptors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68228GSE68229	Illumina sequencing of vaginal epithelial cells from women using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or non-hormonal contraception	"The use of the hormonal contraceptive DMPA has been associated with a moderate increase in sexually transmitted infections, including HIV-1.

Engineered proteins based on the CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE systems have been used to alter genomic DNA sequences, control transcription of endogenous genes, and modify epigenetic states. Although the activity of these proteins at their intended genomic target sites have been assessed, the genome-wide effects of their action have not been extensively characterized. Additionally, the role of chromatin structure in determining the binding of CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE proteins to their target sites and the regulation of nearby genes is poorly understood. Characterization of the activity these proteins using modern high-throughput genomic methods would provide valuable insight into the specificity and off-target effects of CRISPR- and TALE-based genome engineering tools. We have analyzed the genome-wide effects of TALE- and CRISPR-based transcriptional activators targeted to the promoters of two different endogenous human genes in HEK293T cells using a variety of high-throughput DNA sequencing methods. In particular, we assayed the DNA-binding specificity of these proteins and their effects on the epigenome. DNA-binding specificity was evaluated by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq was used to measure the specificity of these activators in perturbing the transcriptome. Additionally, DNase-seq was used to identify the chromatin state at target sites of the synthetic transcriptional activators and the genome-wide chromatin remodeling that occurs as a result of their action. Our results show that these genome engineering technologies are highly specific in both binding to their promoter target sites and inducing expression of downstream genes when multiple activators bind to a single promoter. Moreover, we show that these synthetic activators are able to induce the expression of silent genes in heterochromatic regions of the genome by opening regions of closed chromatin and decreasing DNA methylation. Interestingly, the transcriptional activation domain was not necessary for DNA-binding or chromatin remodeling in these regions, but was critical to inducing gene expression. This study shows that these CRISPR- and TALE-based transcriptional activators are exceptionally specific. Although we detected limited binding of off-target sites in the genome and changes to genome structure, these off-target event did not lead to any detectable changes in gene regulation. Collectively, these results underscore the potential for these technologies to make precise changes to gene expression for gene and cell therapies or fundamental studies of gene function."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68341GSE68358	RNA-seq in two ER+ breast cancer cell lines with and without progestins	Exploring effect of progesterone/progestin treatment on gene expression	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68358GSE68378	Ambient O2 pressure induces NF-kB1/RelA related inflammatory response in human lung epithelial cells in vitro	"Purpose: Oxygen (O2) levels in cell culture conditions is typically 2-5 fold higher than the physiological O2 levels that most tissues experience in vivo. The ambient atmospheric O2 (21%%) is known to induce cell proliferation defects and cellular senescence in stem cell and primary cell cultures. Therefore, culturing these cells under lower O2 levels (2-9%%) is currently a standard practice. However, the non-cancerous immortalized cells and cancer cells, which evade cellular senescence are normally cultured under 21%% O2 levels and the effects of higher O2 levels on these cells are not fully understood. Methods: Gene expression (RNA seq transcriptomics) analysis of immortalized human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells cultured at ambient 21%% O2 and lower 10%% O2 levels for 3 days and 3 weeks. Further the beneficial effects of cuturing cells under lower oxygen tension is evalulated Results: Our results show NF-B/RelA mediated activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines as a major outcome of cells being cultured 21%% O2. Moreover, we demonstrate increased RelA binding at the NF-B1/RelA target gene promoters at 21%% O2. Interestingly, contrary to cells cultutred at 21%% O2, external stress induced by H2O2 exposure did not induce inflammatory response in cells grown at 10%% O2, suggesting increased ability to handle external stress in cells cultured at lower O2 levels."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68378GSE68395	RNA-seq analysis of gene expression patterns during hESC neural differentiation	Thousands of genes expression patterns were displayed.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68395GSE68416	BMAL1 Activates Clock Gene Expression by Regulating Transcription Initiation	"We showed that Bmal1 mainly regulates clock gene initiation, with this functioning being highly conserved across species."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68416GSE68452	Role of cervicovaginal microbiota in genital inflammation	We performed gene expression analysis using the SCRB-Seq method from cervical and peripheral blood antigen presenting cells that were collected from women with different cervicovaginal bacterial community types.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68452GSE68538	CXCR4 regulates extra-medullary myeloma through epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like transcriptional activation	We have developed EMD- and BM-prone and defined the presence of an EMT-like mRNA signature in both EMD- and BM-prone clones.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68538GSE68596	Genome-wide maps of nuclear lamina interactions in single human cells (CEL-seq)	"Mammalian interphase chromosomes interact with the nuclear lamina (NL) through hundreds of large Lamina Associated Domains (LADs). We report a method to map NL contacts genome-wide in single human cells. Analysis of ~400 maps reveals a core architecture of gene-poor LADs that contact the NL with high cell-to-cell consistency, interspersed by LADs with more variable NL interactions. The variable contacts are more sensitive to a change in genome ploidy than the consistent contacts. Single-cell maps indicate that NL contacts involve multivalent interactions over hundreds of kilobases. Moreover, we observe extensive intra-chromosomal coordination of NL contacts, even over tens of megabases. Such coordinated loci exhibit preferential interactions as detected by Hi-C. Finally, single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility analysis shows that loci with consistent NL contacts are expressed at lower levels and are more consistently inaccessible than loci with lower contact frequencies. These results highlight fundamental principles of single cell chromatin organization."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68596GSE68611	RC3H1 posttranscriptionally regulates A20 mRNA and modulates the activity of the IKK/NF-kB pathway [RNA-Seq]	"The RNA-binding protein RC3H1 (also known as ROQUIN) promotes TNFalpha mRNA decay via a 3'UTR constitutive decay element (CDE). Here, we applied PAR-CLIP to human RC3H1 to identify about 3800 mRNA targets with more than 16000 binding sites. A large number of sites are distinct from the consensus CDE and revealed a structure-sequence motif with U-rich sequences embedded in hairpins. RC3H1 binds preferentially short-lived and DNA damage induced mRNAs, indicating a role of this RNA-binding protein in the posttranscriptional regulation of the DNA damage response. Intriguingly, RC3H1 affects expression of NF-kB pathway regulators such as IkBalpha and A20. RC3H1 uses roquin and Zn-finger domains to contact a binding site in the A20 3'UTR, demonstrating a not yet recognized mode of RC3H1 binding. Knockdown of RC3H1 resulted in increased A20 protein expression, thereby interfering with IkB kinase and NF-kB activities, demonstrating that RC3H1 can modulate the activity of the IKK/NF-kB pathway."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68611GSE68631	Ribozyme-enhanced single-stranded Ago2-processed interfering RNA triggers efficient gene silencing with fewer off-target effects.	"RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon of post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated from short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) by Dicer cleavage. Here, we report that siRNA precursors can be divided into two categories with different processing mechanisms and silencing activities that are dependent on stem loop length. We designed an alternative siRNA precursor for triggering RNAi named single-stranded Argonaute2 (Ago2)-processed interfering RNA (saiRNA). saiRNA is composed of a 16-18 bp stem and a loop complementary to the target transcript. The introduction of a self-cleavage ribozyme derived from hepatitis delta virus (HDV) to the 3 end of the saiRNA dramatically improved its silencing activity. Unlike classical shRNA, the strand-specific cleavage of saiRNA by Ago2 during its processing not only eliminated the passenger strand but also avoided the association of mature siRNA with non-nucleolytic Ago proteins, thereby further reducing the risk of off-target effects. Additionally, saiRNA exhibited less competition with the biogenesis of endogenous miRNAs. Therefore, HDV ribozyme-enhanced saiRNA provides a reliable tool for RNAi applications."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68631GSE68645	The DAXX co-repressor is directly recruited to active regulatory elements genome-wide to regulate autophagy programs in a model of human prostate cancer (RNA-seq)	"This study was aimed at understanding the genome-wide binding and regulatory role of the DAXX transcriptional repressor, recently implicated in PCa. ChIP-Seq analysis of genome-wide distribution of DAXX in PC3 cells revealed over 59,000 DAXX binding sites, found at regulatory enhancers and promoters. ChIP-Seq analysis of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which is a key epigenetic partner for DAXX repression, revealed that DNMT1 binding was restricted to a small number of DAXX sites. DNMT1 and DAXX bound close to transcriptional activator motifs. DNMT1 sites were found to be dependent on DAXX for recruitment by analyzing DNMT1 ChIP-Seq following DAXX knockdown (K/D), corroborating previous findings that DAXX recruits DNMT1 to repress its target genes. Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to compare the transcriptomes of WT and DAXX K/D PC3 cells. Genes induced by DAXX K/D included those involved in autophagy, and DAXX ChIP-Seq peaks were found close to the transcription start sites (TSS) of autophagy genes, implying they are more likely to be regulated by DAXX."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68645GSE68671	Differential regulation of alternatively polyadenylated isoforms	"Alternative Cleavage and Polyadenylation (APA) plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression across eukaryotes.

This comparison allowed us to extract APA isoforms that are subjected to differential regulation and provided us with a platform to interrogate the molecular regulatory pathways that shape the APA profiles in the subcellular locations.

Therefore, a large effort has been devoted to the development of new anti-influenza drugs directed to viral targets, as well as to the identification of cellular targets amenable for anti-influenza therapy. Here we describe a new approach to identify such potential cellular targets by screening collections of drugs approved for human use. We reasoned that this would most probably ensure addressing a cellular target and, if successful, the compound would have a well known pharmacological profile. In addition, we reasoned that a screening using a GFP-based recombinant replicon system would address virus trancription/replication and/or gene expression, and hence address a stage in virus infection more useful for inhibition. By using such strategy we identified Montelukast as an inhibitor of virus gene expression, which reduced virus multiplication in virus-infected cells but did not alter virus RNA synthesis in vitro or viral RNA accumulation in vivo. By deep sequencing of RNA isolated from mock- and virus-infected human cells, treated or not with Montelukast, we identified the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response as the pathway responsible for Montelukast action. Accordingly, PERK phosphorylation was inhibited in infected cells but stimulated in Montelukast-treated cells. These results suggest the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response as a potential cellular target to modulate influenza virus infection."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68673GSE68719	mRNA-Seq expression and MS3 proteomics profiling of human post-mortem BA9 brain tissue for Parkinson Disease and neurologically normal individuals	"Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and other proteins in aggregates termed Lewy Bodies within neurons. PD has both genetic and environmental risk factors, and while processes leading to aberrant protein aggregation are unknown, past work points to abnormal levels of SNCA and other proteins. Although several genome-wide studies have been performed for PD, these have focused on DNA sequence variants by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and on RNA levels (microarray transcriptomics), while genome-wide proteomics analysis has been lacking. After appropriate filters, proteomics identified 3,558 unique proteins and 283 of these (7.9%%) were significantly different between PD and controls (q-value<0.05). RNA-sequencing identified 17,580 protein-coding genes and 1,095 of these (6.2%%) were significantly different (FDR p-value<0.05), but only 166 of the FDR significant protein-coding genes (0.94%%) were present among the 3,558 proteins characterized. Of these 166, eight genes (4.8%%) were significant in both studies, with the same direction of effect. Functional enrichment analysis of the proteomics results strongly supports mitochondrial-related pathways, while comparable analysis of the RNA-sequencing results implicates protein folding pathways and metallothioneins. Ten of the implicated genes or proteins co-localized to GWAS loci. Evidence implicating SNCA was stronger in proteomics than in RNA-sequencing analyses. Notably, differentially expressed protein-coding genes were more likely to not be characterized in the proteomics analysis, which lessens the ability to compare across platforms.

Despite advances in treatment options including minimally invasive surgery, CT-guided radiation, novel chemotherapeutic regimens, and targeted therapeutics, prognosis remains dismal. Therefore, further molecular analysis of NSCLC is necessary to identify novel molecular targets that impact prognosis and the design of new-targeted therapies. In recent years, tumor activated/reprogrammed stromal cells that promote carcinogenesis have emerged as potential therapeutic targets. However, the contribution of stromal cells to NSCLC is poorly understood. Here, we show increased numbers of bone marrow (BM)-derived hematopoietic cells in the tumor parenchyma of NSCLC patients compared with matched adjacent non-neoplastic lung tissue. By sorting specific cellular fractions from lung cancer patients, we compared the transcriptomes of intratumoral myeloid compartments within the tumor bed with their counterparts within adjacent non-neoplastic tissue from NSCLC patients. The RNA sequencing of specific myeloid compartments (immature monocytic myeloid cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils) identified differentially regulated genes and mRNA isoforms, which were inconspicuous in whole tumor analysis. Genes encoding secreted factors, including osteopontin (OPN), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (CCL7) and thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) were identified, which enhanced tumorigenic properties of lung cancer cells indicative of their potential as targets for therapy.

Our data indicated that AGO2 binds directly to nascent tRNA and 5S rRNA, and to the genomic loci from which these RNAs are transcribed, in a small RNA- and DICER-independent manner. AGO2 chromatin binding was not observed at non-TFIIIC-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) III genes or at extra-TFIIIC (ETC) sites, indicating that the interaction is specific for TFIIIC-dependent Pol III genes. A genome-wide analysis indicated that loss of AGO2 caused a global increase in the mRNA expression level among genes that flank AGO2-bound tRNA genes. This effect was shown to be distinct from that of the disruption of DICER, DROSHA, or CTCF.

Here, we demonstrate that exosomes released by lung-, liver- and brain-tropic tumor cells fuse preferentially with resident cells at their predicted destination, such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells in the lung, Kupffer cells in the liver, and endothelial cells in the brain. We found that exosome homing to organ-specific cell types prepares the pre-metastatic niche and that treatment with exosomes derived from lung tropic models can redirect metastasis to the lung. Proteomic profiling of exosomes revealed distinct integrin expression patterns associated with each organ-specific metastasis. Whereas exosomal integrins 64 and 61 were associated with lung metastasis, exosomal integrins v5 and v3 were linked with liver and brain metastases, respectively. Targeting 64 and v5 integrins decreased exosome uptake and metastasis in the lung and liver, respectively. Importantly, we demonstrate that exosome uptake activates a cell-specific subset of S100 family genes, known to support cell migration and niche formation. Finally, our clinical data indicate that integrin-expression profiles in circulating plasma exosomes from cancer patients could be used to predict organ-specific metastasis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68919GSE68925	RNAi profiling of primary human AML cells identifies ROCK1 as a therapeutic target and nominates Fasudil as an anti-leukemic drug.	"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a marked genetic heterogeneity, which complicates the development of novel therapeutics. The delineation of pathways essential within the patient-individual mutational background might overcome this limitation and facilitate personalized treatment. We report the results of a large-scale lentiviral loss-offunction RNA-interference-(RNAi)-screen in primary leukemic cells. Stringent validation identified six genes (BNIPL1, ROCK1, RPS13, STK3, SNX27, WDHD1) whose knockdown impaired growth and viability of the cells. Dependence on these genes was not caused by mutation or overexpression and while some of the candidates seemed to be rather patientspecific, others were essential in cells isolated from other AML patients. In addition to the phenotype observed after ROCK1 knockdown, treatment with the approved ROCK-inhibitor fasudil resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased viability of primary AML cells. In contrast to observations in some other malignancies, ROCK1-inhibition did not foster growth of immature malignant progenitors; but was also toxic to this cell fraction in feeder-co-culture and xenotransplantion experiments, indicating a distinct effect of ROCK1 inhibition on leukemic progenitors. We conclude that large scale RNAi screens in primary patient-derived cells are feasible and can complement other methods for personalized cancer therapies, such as expression and mutation profiling."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68925GSE68938	"RNA:DNA hybrids in the human genome have distinctive nucleotide characteristics, chromatin composition, and transcriptional relationships (RNA-seq)"	"Mapping of RNA:DNA hybrids in human cells reveals a number of characteristics of these non-canonical nucleic acid structures.

Studies of chromatin at RNA:DNA hybrids shows the presence of the ILF2 and ILF3 transcription factors, supporting a model of certain transcription factors binding preferentially to the RNA:DNA conformation. Overall, there is little to indicate a dependence for RNA:DNA hybrids forming co-transcriptionally, with results from the ribosomal DNA repeat unit instead supporting a model of RNA generating these structures in trans. The results of the study indicate heterogeneous functions of these genomic elements and new insights into their formation and stability in vivo."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68938GSE68975	Activation of proto-oncogenes by disruption of chromosome neighborhoods [RNA-Seq]	"Mutations such as gene fusion, translocation and focal amplification are a frequent cause of proto-oncogene activation during tumorigenesis, but such mutations do not explain all cases of proto-oncogene activation. Here we show that disruption of local chromosome conformation can also activate proto-oncogenes in human cells. We mapped chromosome structures in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and found that active oncogenes and silent proto-oncogenes generally occur within insulated neighborhoods formed by the looping of two interacting CTCF sites co-occupied by cohesin. Recurrent microdeletions frequently overlap neighborhood boundary sites in T-ALL genomes, and we demonstrate that site-specific perturbation of loop boundaries is sufficient to activate the respective proto-oncogenes in non-malignant cells. We found somatic genomic rearrangements affecting loop boundaries in many cancers. These results suggest that chromosome structural organization is fundamental to identify functional somatic alterations in cancer genomes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68975GSE69021	Gene target specificity of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) family: How HIV-1 Tat employs selected SEC members to activate viral transcription	"The AF4/FMR2 proteins AFF1 and AFF4 act as a scaffold to assemble the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) that strongly activates transcriptional elongation of HIV-1 and cellular genes. Although they can dimerize, it is unclear whether the dimers exist and function within a SEC in vivo. Furthermore, it is unknown whether AFF1 and AFF4 function similarly in mediating SEC-dependent activation of diverse genes. Providing answers to these questions, our current study shows that AFF1 and AFF4 reside in separate SECs that display largely distinct gene target specificities. While the AFF1-SEC is more potent in supporting HIV-1 transactivation by the viral Tat protein, the AFF4-SEC is more important for HSP70 induction upon heat shock. The functional difference between AFF1 and AFF4 in Tat-transactivation has been traced to a single amino acid variation between the two proteins, which causes them to enhance the affinity of Tat for P-TEFb, a key SEC component, with different efficiency. Finally, genome-wide analysis confirms that the genes regulated by AFF1- and AFF4-SEC are largely non-overlapping and perform distinct functions. Thus, the SEC represents a family of related complexes that exist to increase the regulatory diversity and gene control options during transactivation of diverse cellular and viral genes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69021GSE69092	"ELAVL2-regulated transcriptional networks in human neurons link atlernative splicing, autism and human neocortical evolution"	"The role of post-transcriptional gene regulation in human brain development and cognitive diseases remains mostly uncharacterized. ELAV-like RNA binding proteins are a family of proteins that regulate several aspects of neuronal function including neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. Here, we identify the downstream transcriptional networks of ELAVL2, an RNA-binding protein with unknown function in the brain. We knockdown expression of ELAVL2 in human neurons and conduct RNA-sequencing, identifying networks of differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes with altered ELAVL2. These networks contain autism-relevant genes as well as previously identified targets of other RNA binding proteins implicated in autism spectrum disorders such as RBFOX1 and FMRP. ELAVL2-regulated coexpression networks are also enriched for synaptic genes as well as genes with human-specific patterns of gene expression in the frontal pole. Together, these data suggest that ELAVL2 regulation of transcript expression is critical for neuronal functions at risk in autism spectrum disorders and such mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulation may have contributed to human brain evolution."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69092GSE69121	Mastermind-like 3 controls proliferation and differentiation in neuroblastoma (RNA-seq)	"Neuroblastoma cell lines can differentiate upon retinoic acid (RA) treatment, a finding that provided the basis for the clinical use of RA to treat neuroblastoma. However, resistance to RA is often observed, which limits its clinical utility. Using a gain-of-function genetic screen we identify the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind-like 3 (MAML3) as a gene whose ectopic expression confers resistance to RA. We find that MAML3 expression leads to loss of activation of a subset of RA target genes, which hampers RA-induced differentiation. The regulatory DNA elements of this subset of RA target genes show overlap in binding of MAML3 and the retinoic acid receptor, suggesting a role for MAML3 in the regulation of these genes. In addition, MAML3 has RA independent functions, including the activation of IGF1R and downstream AKT signaling via upregulation of IGF2, resulting in increased proliferation. Our results indicate an important role for MAML3 in differentiation and proliferation of neuroblastomas."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69121GSE69125	The effect of knockdown Abl kinases on breast cancer cells' global transcriptome	"To gain insight into the signaling pathway(s) required for ABL1/ABL2-dependent bone metastasis, we evaluated the consequences of single or double inactivation of ABL1 and ABL2 on the transcriptome of breast cancer cells. Double ABL1/ABL2 knockdown was required to decrease the levels of p-CrKL by more than 90%%, indicative of inactivation of the endogenous ABL kinases. To examine the consequences of depleting the ABL kinases on the transcriptome of metastatic breast cancer cells we employed next generation sequencing (RNAseq) analysis. We found that 180 genes were significantly down-regulated and 40 genes were significantly up-regulated in ABL1/ABL2 knockdown cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69125GSE69164	Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals that ECM-Receptor Interaction contributes to the venous metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma	"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common kind of liver cancer in the world. Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is one of the most serious complications of HCC and strongly correlated to a poor prognosis for HCC patients. However, the detailed mechanisms of PVTT development still remains to be explored. In this study, we presented the large scale transcriptome analysis of 11 HCC with PVTT patients by RNA-sequencing. The dysregulated genes between HCC and PVTT suggested that the ECM-Receptor Interaction was correlated to the venous metastases of HCC. Among all the recurrent alternative splicing events, we identified exon 6 skipping of RPS24, which is likely to be a cancer driver. We also identified five common fusion genes between HCC and its corresponding PVTT samples, including ARID1A-GPATCH3, MDM1-NUP107, PTGES3-RARG, PRLR-TERT and C9orf3-TMC1. All of the findings broaden our knowledge in PVTT development and may also contribute to the diagnosis and treatment for HCC patients with PVTT."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69164GSE69192	Circular RNAs are enriched in anucleate platelets and are a signature of transcriptome degradation	"In platelets, splicing and translation occur in the absence of a nucleus. However, the integrity and stability of mRNAs derived from megakaryocyte progenitor cells remain poorly quantified on a transcriptome-wide level. As circular RNAs (circRNAs) are resistant to degradation by exonucleases, their abundance relative to linear RNAs can be used as a surrogate marker for mRNA stability in the absence of transcription. Here we show that circRNAs are enriched in human platelets 17-188 fold relative to nucleated tissues, and 14-26 fold relative to samples digested with RNAseR to selectively remove linear RNA. We compare RNAseq read depths inside and outside circRNAs to provide in silico evidence of transcript circularity, show that exons within circRNAs are enriched ~13X in platelets relative to nucleated tissues, and identify 3162 genes significantly enriched for circRNAs including some where all RNAs appear to be derived from circular molecules. We also confirm that this is a feature of other anucleate cells through transcriptome sequencing of mature erythrocytes, demonstrate that circRNAs are not enriched in megakaryocytes, and that linear RNAs decay more rapidly than circRNAs in platelet preparations. Collectively, these results suggest that circulating platelets have lost on aveage over 90%% of their progenitor mRNAs, and that translation in platelets occurrs against the backdrop of a highly degraded transcriptome. Finally, we find that transcripts classified as products of reverse transcriptase template switching are both enriched in platelets and resistant to decay, countering the recent suggestion that up to 50%% of rearranged RNAs are artefacts."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69192GSE69197	RNA sequencing of matched nephrectomy samples [RNA-seq]	"To address the need to study frozen clinical specimens using next-generation RNA, DNA, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and protein analyses, we developed a biobank work flow to prospectively collect biospecimens from patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We describe our standard operating procedures and work flow to annotate pathologic results and clinical outcomes. We report quality control outcomes, nucleic acid yields of our RCC submissions (N=16) to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, as well as newer discovery platforms by describing mass spectrometry analysis of albumin oxidation in plasma and 6 ChIP sequencing libraries generated from nephrectomy specimens after histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) immunoprecipitation. From June 1, 2010, through January 1, 2013, we enrolled 328 patients with RCC. Our mean (SD) TCGA RNA integrity numbers (RINs) were 8.1 (0.8) for papillary RCC, with a 12.5%% overall rate of sample disqualification for RIN <7. Banked plasma had significantly less albumin oxidation (by mass spectrometry analysis) than plasma kept at 25C (P<.001). For ChIP sequencing, the FastQC score for average read quality was at least 30 for 91-95%% of paired-end reads. In parallel, we analyzed frozen tissue by RNA sequencing and after genome alignments, only 0.2-0.4%% of total reads failed the default quality check steps of Bowtie2, which was comparable to the disqualification ratio (0.1%%) of the 786-O RCC cell line, prepared under optimal RNA isolation conditions. The overall correlation coefficients for gene expression between the Mayo Clinic vs. TCGA tissues ranged from 0.75 to 0.82. These data support the generation of high-quality nucleic acids for genomic analyses from banked RCC. Importantly, the protocol does not interfere with routine clinical care.

Over 3,000 genes encoding previously unknown long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) were revealed through the analysis of these rare populations. Lymphoid commitment was characterized by lncRNA expression patterns that were highly stage specific and were more lineage specific than those of protein-coding genes. Protein-coding genes co-expressed with neighboring lncRNA genes showed enrichment for ontologies related to lymphoid differentiation. The exquisite cell-type specificity of global lncRNA expression patterns independently revealed new developmental relationships among the earliest progenitor cells in the human bone marrow and thymus."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69239GSE69240	A Molecular Portrait Of High-Grade Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) [RNA-seq]	"DCIS is a non-invasive precursor lesion to invasive breast carcinoma. We still have no understanding on why only some DCIS lesions evolve to invasive cancer while others appear not to do so during the life span of the patient. Here, we performed full exome (tumor vs. matching normal), transcriptome and methylome analysis of 30 pure high-grade DCIS (HG-DCIS) and 10 normal breast epithelial samples. Sixty two percent of HG-DCIS cases displayed mutations affecting cancer driver genes or potential drivers. Mutations were observed affecting PIK3CA (21%% of cases), TP53 (17%%), GATA3 (7%%), MLL3 (7%%) and single cases of mutations affecting CDH1, MAP2K4, TBX3, NF1, ATM and ARID1A. Significantly, 83%% of lesions displayed numerous large chromosomal copy number alterations, suggesting they might precede selection of cancer driver mutations. Integrated pathway-based modeling analysis of RNA-seq data allowed us to identify two DCIS subgroups (DCIS-C1 and DCIS-C2) based on their tumor intrinsic subtypes, proliferative, immune scores and in the activity of specific signaling pathways. The more aggressive DCIS-C1 (highly proliferative, basal-like or ERBB2+) displayed signatures characteristic of activated Treg cells (CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+) and CTLA4+/CD86+ complexes indicative of a tumor-associated immune suppressive phenotype. Strikingly, all lesions showed evidence of TP53 pathway inactivation. Similarly ncRNA and methylation profiles reproduce changes observed post-invasion. Among the most significant findings we observed upregulation of lncRNA HOTAIR in DCIS-C1 lesions and hypermethylation of HOXA5 and specific SOX genes. We conclude that most HG-DCIS lesions, in spite of representing a pre-invasive stage of tumor progression, displayed molecular profiles indistinguishable from invasive breast cancer."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69240GSE69241	"Analysis of human, chimpanzee, macaque and mouse tissue transcriptomes using Next Generation Sequencing"	"We performed deep strand-specific sequencing of poly-adenylated RNA (polyA+ RNAseq) from human, chimpanzee, macaque and mouse tissues, with the goal of detecting numerous non-annotated poorly expressed and antisense genes.

In this work, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Gata6 can initiate reprograming of multiple cell types to induced extraembryonic endoderm (iXEN) cells. Intriguingly, Gata6 is sufficient to drive iXEN cells from mouse pluripotent cells and differentiated neural cells. Furthermore, GATA6 induction in human ES (hES) cells also downregulates pluripotency gene expression and upregulates extraembryonic endoderm genes, revealing a conserved function in mediating this cell fate switch. Profiling transcriptional changes following Gata6 induction in mES cells reveals step-wise pluripotency factor disengagement, with initial repression of Nanog and Esrrb, then Sox2 and finally Oct4, alongside step-wise activation of extraembryonic endoderm genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and subsequent high-throughput sequencing analysis shows Gata6 enrichment near both pluripotency and endoderm genes, suggesting that Gata6 functions as both a direct repressor and activator. Together this demonstrates that Gata6 is a versatile and potent reprogramming factor that can act alone to drive a cell fate switch from diverse cell types."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69322GSE69333	TET-catalyzed 5-hydroxymethylcytosine regulates gene expression in differentiating colonocytes and colon cancer	5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-mC) and gene expression profiling of T84 cell differentiation; 5-hmC profiling of colon cancer colonocyte fractions	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69333GSE69352	Tunable protein synthesis by transcript isoforms in human cells (Transcript Isoforms in Polysomes sequencing: TrIP-seq)	"Eukaryotic genes generate multiple mRNA transcript isoforms though alternative transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation. However, the relationship between human transcript diversity and protein production is complex as each isoform can be translated differently. We fractionated a polysome profile and reconstructed transcript isoforms from each fraction, which we term Transcript Isoforms in Polysomes sequencing (TrIP-seq). Analysis of these data revealed regulatory features that control ribosome occupancy and translational output of each transcript isoform. We extracted a panel of 5 and 3 untranslated regions that control protein production from an unrelated gene in cells over a 100-fold range. Select 5 untranslated regions exert robust translational control between cell lines, while 3 untranslated regions can confer cell-type-specific expression. These results expose the large dynamic range of transcript-isoform-specific translational control, identify isoform-specific sequences that control protein output in human cells, and demonstrate that transcript isoform diversity must be considered when relating RNA and protein levels."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69352GSE69383	The apoptotic network and expression of BH3-containing proteins predict phenotypic response to BET bromodomain inhibitors	"Small molecule inhibitors of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins are in clinical trials for a variety of cancers, but patient selection strategies are limited. This is due in part to the heterogeneity of response following BET inhibition (BETi), which includes differentiation, senescence, and cell death in subsets of cancer cell lines. To elucidate the dominant features defining response to BETi, we carried out phenotypic and gene expression analysis of both treatment nave cell lines and engineered tolerant lines. We found that both de novo and acquired tolerance to BET inhibition are driven by the robustness of the apoptotic response and that genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the apoptotic signaling network can modify the phenotypic response to BETi. We further identify that ordered expression of the apoptotic genes BCL2, BCL2L1, and BAD significantly predicts response to BETi. Our findings highlight the role of the apoptotic network in response to BETi, providing a molecular basis for patient stratification and combination therapies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69383GSE69405	Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung adenocarcinoma patient-derived cells	"To address how intratumoral heterogeneity affects anti-cancer drug responses, we profiled transcriptomes of single cancer cells originating from lung adenocarcinoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69405GSE69415	Fra-1 is a key driver of colon cancer metastasis and a Fra-1 classifier predicts disease-free survival	"Background and Aim: Fra-1 (Fos-related antigen-1) is a member of the AP1 (activator protein-1) family of transcription factors. We have recently shown that Fra-1 is necessary for breast cancer cells to metastasize in vivo, and that breast cancer outcome can be predicted by a classifier comprising genes that are expressed in a Fra-1-dependent fashion. Here, we show that Fra-1 plays an important role also in colon cancer progression. Methods: We compared proliferation rates of parental and Fra-1-depleted colon cancer cells in vitro under 2D, 3D, and attachment-free conditions and in vivo upon subcutaneous and intravenous injections into mice. We also compared RNA expression profiles of colon cancer cells with and without Fra-1 expression. Results: Fra-1 depletion impair colony outgrowth of human colon cancer cells in soft agar and in suspension, whereas it does not affect proliferation on 2D culture plates. Consistent with this, upon subcutaneous injection into mice, tumors formed by Fra-1-depleted colon cancer cells are only three times smaller than those produced by control cells. In contrast, when injected intravenously, Fra-1 depletion causes 200-fold reduction in tumor burden. Consistent with the more aggressive characteristics of Fra-1-proficient tumors, the prognosis of colon cancer patients can be predicted by a Fra-1 classifier generated by comparing RNA profiles of parental and Fra-1-depleted colon cancer cells. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Fra-1 is an important determinant of the metastatic potential of human colon cancer cells, and suggest that a Fra-1 classifier can be used as a prognostic predictor in colon cancer patients."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69415GSE69434	The protein and transcript profiles of human semen	Transcriptome of testes was examined for comparison of transcript abundance with that of sperm/seminal fluid (as sequenced in separate study)	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69434GSE69471	Combined ultra-low input mRNA and whole-genome sequencing from human embryonic stem cells	"Next Generation Sequencing has proven to be an exceptionally powerful tool in the field of genomics and transcriptomics. With recent development it is nowadays possible to analyze ultra-low input sample material down to single cells. Nevertheless investigating such sample material still limits the analysis to either the genome or transcriptome, hence a combined analysis of both types of nucleic acids from the same sample material is still in demand.We developed a protocol which enables the combined analysis of the genome as well as the transcriptome by Next Generation Sequencing from ultra-low input samples. The protocol was evaluated by sequencing sub-colony structures from human embryonic stem cells containing 150 to 200 cells. The method can be adapted to any available sequencing system (e.g. Illumina, SOLiD, 454, etc.).To our knowledge, this is the first report where sub-colonies of human embryonic stem cells have been analyzed both at the genomic as well as transcriptome level. The method of this proof of concept study may find useful practical applications for cases where only a limited number of cells are available, e.g. for tissues samples from biopsies, circulating tumor cells and cells from early embryonic development.

The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is made up of multiple subunits that can be filled by mutually exclusive proteins. Inclusion or exclusion of these proteins has profound functional consequences, yet we currently understand little about the direct functional relationship between these biochemically distinct forms of remodeling complexes. Here we combine chromatin immunoprecipitation, transcriptome analysis, and transcription factor binding information from the ENCODE project to determine the functional relationship between three biochemically distinct forms of SWI/SNF. We find widespread overlap in transcriptional regulation and the genomic binding of the three ARID (AT-Rich Interacting Domain) subunits of SWI/SNF. Despite the numerous similarities in their transcriptional regulation and the co-factors bound with each ARID we identify several novel interaction modalities. Previous work has found examples of competition or subunit switching at individual loci, and we find this functional relationship is widespread, and in these cases gene expression changes following loss of one ARID depend on the function of another ARID. We also identify a previously unknown cooperative interaction between ARID1B and ARID2 in the repression of a large number of genes.

"Diagnosis of brucellosis remains challenging for several reasons, including lack of culture sensitivity, nonspecific symptomatology, and high prevalence of positive serology in endemic areas. The main objectives of this study were to identify blood biomarkers specific to brucellosis compared to other endemic infections and to monitor changes in blood biomarkers during treatment. To obtain a global profile of the disease, we employed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of whole blood RNA to measure host response against brucellosis infection in patients from Macedonia and Spain. Long-term follow up of patients was used to classify patients as having acute or chronic/reinfection brucellosis and as treatment responders and non-responders. We observed distinct gene expression differences between samples from acute brucellosis and control donors. The magnitude of gene expression changes was associated with antibody titers determined by standard serological tests for brucellosis, including the rose Bengal and standard agglutination tests. The expression signature characteristic of acute brucellosis was also different from that of subjects with leishmaniasis.

Methods: MCF7 cells were transfected with siRNAs against CEBPD or control. After 48h transfection total RNAs from two independent experiments were extracted and subjected to deep sequencing following Illumina standard protocols. Results: Samples were aligned to the reference human genome hg19 with good alignment ranging from 84  85%% for both reads and very low mismatch rates <0.35%%. RNA mapping statistics calculated using Picard software reported mapping of samples to 86 %% mRNA bases, 63-65%% unique reads, and <2.6%% ribosomal reads. The aligned BAM files were imported into Partek Genome Studio v6.4 following the RNA-Seq workflow. Briefly, metadata about the samples was added followed by normalizing counts and doing differential expression analysis with ANOVA for the siNS vs siCEBPD contrasts. Differential gene list were created based on a p-value cutoff of <0.05 and fold-change of >1.5 or < -1.5. Analysis revealed that C/EBP supports the expression of 319 genes (downregulated by siCEBPD) and attenuates the expression of 238 genes (induced by siCEBPD). For validation, 31 genes were assessed by QPCR with mRNA samples independent of those used for mRNA-Seq, and also by silencing CEBPD with either one of two siRNA sequences. About 90%% of the tested genes from the mRNA-Seq approach were validated as C/EBP-regulated in MCF-7 cells by QPCR.

However, the functions of species- and lineage-specific splice variants are largely unknown. Here, we show that mammalian-specific skipping of exon 9 of PTBP1 alters its splicing regulatory activities and affects the inclusion levels of numerous exons. During neurogenesis, skipping of exon 9 reduces PTBP1 repressive activity so as to facilitate activation of a brain-specific AS program. Engineered skipping of the orthologous exon in chicken cells induces a large number of mammalian-like AS changes in PTBP1 target exons. These results thus reveal that a single exon skipping event in an RNA binding regulator directs numerous AS changes between species. The results further suggest that these changes contributed to evolutionary differences in the formation of vertebrate nervous systems."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69656GSE69667	A systematic analysis of the time series gene expression in TGF-beta induced EMT by Next-generation sequencing	"The goal of this study is to characterize time course gene expression profiles during TGF-beta induced EMT.

We generated isogenic leukemia cell clones in which the FLT3 gene was disrupted in a single allele using TALENs. Isogenic clones with mono-allelic disrupted FLT3 were compared to an isogenic wild-type control clone and parental leukemia cells for transcriptional expression, downstream FLT3 signaling and proliferation capacity. The global gene expression profiles of mutant K562 clones and corresponding wild-type controls were compared using RNA-seq. The transcriptional levels and the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of FLT3 were decreased in the mutant clones. TALENs-mediated FLT3 haplo-insufficiency impaired cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro. These inhibitory effects were maintained in vivo, improving the survival of NOD/SCID mice transplanted with mutant K562 clones. Cluster analysis revealed that the gene expression pattern of isogenic clones was determined by the FLT3 mutant status rather than the deviation among individual isogenic clones. Differentially expressed genes between the mutant and wild-type clones revealed an activation of nonsense-mediated decay pathway in mutant K562 clones as well as an inhibited FLT3 signaling. Our data support that this genome-editing approach is a robust and generally applicable platform to explore the molecular bases of gene mutations."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69678GSE69687	Wnt addiction of genetically defined cancers reversed by PORCN inhibition	"Enhanced sensitivity to Wnts is an emerging hallmark of a subset of cancers, defined in part by mutations regulating the abundance of their receptors.

Previous work has established that differentiation protocols produce cortical neurons but little has been done to characterise these at cellular resolution. In particular, it is unclear to what extent in vitro two-dimensional, relatively disordered culture conditions recapitulate the development of in vivo cortical layer identity. Single cell multiplex RT-qPCR was used to interrogate the expression of genes previously implicated in cortical layer or phenotypic identity in individual cells. Unexpectedly, 22.7%% of neurons analysed frequently co-expressed canonical fetal deep and upper cortical layer markers, and this co-expression was also present at the level of translated protein. By comparing our results to available single cell RNA-seq data from human fetal and adult brain, we observed that this co-expression of layer markers was also seen in primary tissue. These results suggest that establishing neuronal layer identity in iPSC-derived or primary cortical neurons using canonical marker genes transcripts is unlikely to be informative."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69790GSE69822	Perturbations of PIP3 signaling trigger a global remodeling of mRNA landscape and reveal a transcriptional feedback loop	"PIP3 is synthesized by PI3Ks and regulates complex cell responses, such as growth and migration. Signals that drive long-term reshaping of cell phenotypes are difficult to resolve because of complex feedback networks that operate over extended times. It is clear PIP3-dependent modulation of mRNA accumulation is important in this process but is poorly understood. We have quantified the genome-wide mRNA-landscape of non-transformed, breast epithelium-derived MCF10a cells and its response to transient (EGF or PI3Ka-selective inhibitor) or chronic (isogenic cells expressing an oncomutant PI3Ka allele or lacking the PIP3-phosphatase /tumour-suppressor, PTEN) perturbations of PIP3.These results show that whilst many mRNAs are changed by long-term genetic perturbation of PIP3 signaling (butterfly effect), a much smaller number change with a directional logic that aligns with different PIP3 perturbations, allowing discrimination of more directly regulated mRNAs. Our results also indicate that mRNAs can be differentially sensitive to specific features of PIP3 signals, that PIP3-sensitive mRNAs encode PI3K pathway components and identify the transcription factor binding motifs SRF and PRDM1 as important regulators of PIP3-sensitive mRNAs involved in cell movement."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69822GSE69896	Cellular androgen content influences enzalutamide agonism of F877L mutant androgen receptor	"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed and second-most lethal cancer among men in the United States. The vast majority of prostate cancer deaths are due to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)  the lethal form of the disease that has progressed despite therapies that interfere with activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. One emergent resistance mechanism to medical castration is synthesis of intratumoral androgens that activate the AR. This insight led to the development of the AR antagonist enzalutamide. However, resistance to enzalutamide invariably develops, and disease progression is nearly universal. One mechanism of resistance to enzalutamide is an F877L mutation in the AR ligand-binding domain that can convert enzalutamide to an agonist of AR activity. However, mechanisms that contribute to the agonist switch had not been fully clarified, and there were no therapies to block AR F877L. Using cell line models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we determined that cellular androgen content influences enzalutamide agonism of mutant F877L AR. Further, enzalutamide treatment of AR F877L-expressing cell lines recapitulated the effects of androgen activation of F877L AR or wild-type AR. Because the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ-1 was previously shown to block androgen activation of wild-type AR, we tested JQ-1 in AR F877L-expressing CRPC models. We determined that JQ-1 suppressed androgen or enzalutamide activation of mutant F877L AR and suppressed growth of mutant F877L AR CRPC tumors in vivo, demonstrating a new strategy to treat tumors harboring this mutation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69896GSE69905	5-hydroxymethylcytosine poises expression of genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation	"Epigenetic processes regulate hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis. The recent discovery of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) provides new insights into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during development. We used reduced representation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine profiling (RRHP) to characterize the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. We show that 5hmC levels decrease during cell differentiation and that 5hmC is associated with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac histone modifications, indicative of active enhancers. In CD34+ cells, the presence of 5hmC at presumed active enhancers correlates with increased binding of RUNX1 and FLI1, two transcription factors essential for hematopoiesis. Moreover, in progenitor cells, 5hmC poises the expression of transcription factors regulating hematopoietic lineage commitment, such as RUNX1, FOXO1 and C/EBP-alpha. Our study provides the first comprehensive genome-wide overview of 5hmC distribution in human hematopoietic cells and of its potential role in transcriptional network regulation during hematopoiesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69905GSE69906	The transcription and translation landscapes during human cytomegalovirus infection reveal novel host-pathogen interactions	"During its long infection cycle, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) extensively manipulates cellular gene expression to maintain conditions favorable for viral propagation.

The aim of this study was to characterize changes in TG-specific T cell responses as a function of seasonality. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained either during the pollen season or out of season, from allergic individuals and non-allergic controls were stimulated either with TG extract or a pool of previously identified immunodominant antigenic regions. PBMC from in season allergic subjects exhibit higher IL-5 and IL-10 responses compared to out of season donors. In the case of non-allergic subjects, as expected we observed lower IL-5 responses and robust production of IFN compared to allergic individuals. Strikingly, non-atopic donors exhibited an opposing pattern with decreased immune reactivity in-season. The broad downregulation in non-allergic donors indicates that healthy individuals are not oblivious to allergen exposure but rather react with an active modulation of the responses following the antigenic stimulus provided during the pollen season. Transcriptomic analysis of allergen-specific T cells defined genes modulated in concomitance with allergen exposure and inhibition of responses in non-allergic donors. Magnitude and functionality of T-helper cell responses differ substantially for in season versus out of season in allergic and non-allergic subjects. The results indicate specific and opposing modulation of immune responses following the antigenic stimulation during the pollen season. This seasonal modulation reflects the enactment of specific molecular programs associated with health and allergic disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70050GSE70061	Nuclear HNRNPA2B1 HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq	"To identify HNRNPA2B1 binding sites on endogenous nuclear RNAs, we performed HITS-CLIP for endogenous HNRNPA2B1 and RNA-seq to analyze the nuclear RNA under either METTL3 or HNRNPA2B1 depletion."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70061GSE70068	RNA-Seq analysis of human neutrophils isolated by different protocols (Polymorphprep and negative selection) and incubated with and without in vitro cytokine stimulation	"We report gene expression in human neutrophils isolated by two methods: Polymorphprep (~95%% purity) and negative selection (~99%% purity) from two healthy donors - one donor with low eosinophil contamination of neutrophils and one donor with high eosinophil contamination of neutrophils.

Here we show that 16 independent primary HGSCs contain a CA125 negative population enriched for carboplatin resistant cancer initiating cells. Transcriptome analysis reveals up-regulation of homologous recombination DNA repair and anti-apoptotic signals in this population. While treatment with carboplatin enriches for CA125 negative cells, co-treatment with carboplatin and birinapant eliminates these cells in HGSCs expressing high levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein cIAP in the CA125 negative population. Birinapant sensitizes CA125 negative cells to carboplatin by mediating degradation of cIAP causing cleavage of caspase-8 and restoration of apoptosis. This co-therapy significantly improved disease free survival in vivo compared to either therapy alone in tumor-bearing mice.

The ten-eleven translocation (TET) gene family is able to oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxmethylcytosine (5hmC), providing an active mechanism for DNA demethylation, and may also provide its own regulatory function. Here we applied oxidative bisulfite sequencing to generate whole-genome DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation maps at single-base resolution in paired human liver and lung normal and cancer. We found that 5hmC is significantly enriched in CpG island (CGI) shores while depleted in CGS themselves, in particular at active genes, resulting in a 5hmC but not 5mC bimodal distribution around CGI corresponding to H3K4me1 marks. Hydroxymethylation on promoters, gene bodies, and transcription termination regions showed strong positive correlation with gene expression within and across tissues, suggesting that 5hmC is a mark of active genes and could play a role gene expression mediated by DNA demethylation. Comparative analysis of methylomes and hydroxymethylomes at differentially methylated regions (DMRs) revealed that 5hmC is significantly enriched in both tissue specific DMRs (t-DMRs) and cancer specific DMRs (c-DMRs), and 5hmC is negatively correlated with methylation changes, particularly in non-CGI associated DMRs. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in normal and tumor tissues revealed that gain or loss of 5hmC negatively correlated with changes in 5mC, especially on non-CGI associated DMRs, suggesting a profound role for hydroxymethylation in regulation of dynamic DNA demethylation. Together these findings indicate that changes in 5mC as well as in 5hmC and coupled to H3K4me1 correspond to differential gene expression in tissues and matching tumors, revealing an intricate gene expression regulation through interplay of methylome, hydroxymethylome, and histone modifications."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70089GSE70106	The role of antigen presenting cells in the induction of HIV-1 latency in resting CD4+ T-cells	"BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is able to control HIV-1 viral replication, however long-lived latent infection in resting memory CD4+ T-cells persist. The mechanisms for establishment and maintenance of latent infection in resting memory CD4+ T-cells remain unclear. Previously we have shown that HIV-1 infection of resting CD4+ T-cells co-cultured with CD11c+ myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) produced a population of non-proliferating T-cells with latent infection. Here we asked whether different antigen presenting cells (APC), including subpopulations of DC and monocytes, were able to induce post-integration latent infection in resting CD4+ T-cells, and examined potential cell interactions that may be involved using RNA-seq. RESULTS: mDC (CD1c+), SLAN+ DC and CD14+ monocytes were most efficient in stimulating proliferation of CD4+ T-cells during syngeneic culture and in generating post-integration latent infection in non-proliferating CD4+ T-cells following HIV-1 infection of APC-T-cell co-cultures. In comparison, plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and B-cells did not induce latent infection in APC-T-cell co-cultures. We compared the RNA expression profiles of APC subpopulations that could and could not induce latency in non-proliferating CD4+ T-cells. Gene expression analysis, comparing the mDC, SLAN+ DC and CD14+ monocyte subpopulations to pDC identified 53 upregulated genes that encode proteins expressed on the plasma membrane that could signal to CD4+ T-cells via cell-cell interactions (32 genes), immune checkpoints (IC) (5 genes), T-cell activation (9 genes), regulation of apoptosis (5 genes), antigen presentation (1 gene) and through unknown ligands (1 gene). CONCLUSIONS: APC subpopulations from the myeloid lineage, specifically mDC subpopulations and CD14+ monocytes, were able to efficiently induce post-integration HIV-1 latency in non-proliferating CD4+ T-cells in vitro. Inhibition of key pathways involved in mDC-T-cell interactions and HIV-1 latency may provide novel targets to eliminate HIV latency."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70106GSE70189	Human and mouse DRIP-seq and DRIPc-seq	This study profiles RNA:DNA hybrid formation in human and mouse cell lines.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70189GSE70211	Rocaglamide A converts RNA helicase eIF4A into a sequence-specific translational repressor	"Rocaglamide A (RocA) typifies a novel class of protein synthesis inhibitors that selectively kill aneuploid tumor cells and repress translation of specific mRNAs. RocA targets eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), the prototypical DEAD-box RNA helicase, and its mRNA selectivity is proposed to reflect highly structured 5 UTRs that are very dependent on eIF4A-mediated unwinding. Here, we show that secondary structure in 5 UTRs is only a minor determinant for RocA selectivity and RocA does not repress translation by reducing eIF4A activity. Rather, in vitro and in vivo, RocA clamps eIF4A onto a specific sequence motif even after ATP hydrolysis. This artificially clamped eIF4A blocks 43S scanning, leading to premature, upstream translation initiation and reducing gene expression on transcripts bearing the RocA-eIF4A target sequence. In elucidating the mechanism of this lead anti-cancer compound and explaining its mRNA selectivity, we provide the first example of a drug stabilizing sequence-specific RNA-protein interactions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70211GSE70285	Measure transcript integrity using RNA-seq data	"Achieved biospecimens annotated with patient clinical characteristics are unique resources for translational research. However, RNA extracted from the achieved tissues is often degraded. RNA degradation can have a significant impact on the measure of transcript abundance that can lead to an increase rate of erroneous differentially expressed genes. Here, we are presenting the transcript integrity number (TIN) algorithm to measure the RNA degradation at transcript level. When applied to RNA-seq datasets generated from human brain Glioblastome cell line, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) clinical tissues, TIN provided a more reliable and more sensitive measure of RNA degradation than RIN, as demonstrated by much higher concordance with the RNA fragment size estimated from read pairs. More importantly, when comparing 10 mCRPC samples with lower RNA quality to another 10 samples with higher RNA quality, we demonstrated that calibrating gene quantification with TIN scores could mitigate RNA degradation effects and greatly improve gene expression analysis. The detected differentially expressed genes before TIN correction were predominantly ribosomal genes. However, when we adjusted gene quantifications with the corresponding TIN scores, we found differentially expressed genes were highly enriched in prostate cancer specific pathways. When further evaluating the performance of TIN correction using synthetic spike-in transcripts with predetermined abundance in RNA-seq data generated from Sequencing Control Consortium (SEQC), we found TIN adjustment had a better control of false positives and false negatives (sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.91), as compared to gene expression analysis results without TIN correction (sensitivity =0.98, specificity = 0.50)."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70285GSE70299	The evolution of N6-methyladenosine in primates	"Phenotypic differences within populations and between closely related species are often driven by variation and evolution of gene expression. However, most analyses have focused on the effects of genomic variation at cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers that control transcriptional activity, and little is understood about the influence of post-transcriptional processes on transcript evolution. Post-transcriptional modification of RNA by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to be widespread throughout the transcriptome, and this reversible mark can affect transcript stability and translation dynamics. Here we analyze m6A mRNA modifications in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from human, chimpanzee and rhesus, and we identify patterns of m6A evolution among species. We find that m6A evolution occurs in parallel with evolution of consensus RNA sequence motifs known to be associated with the enzymatic complexes that regulate m6A dynamics, and expression evolution of m6A-modified genes occurs in a parallel evolutionary pattern with m6A evolution. Further, genes modified by evolved m6A in humans are significantly enriched in transcriptional regulatory processes and disease related pathways, suggesting an important role in human biology for the evolution of m6A modification."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70299GSE70330	ncRNA (non-coding RNA) signature in endothelial cells during hypoxia [RNA-seq]	"To define ncRNA expression in hypoxic endothelial cells, we applied pro-angiogenic hypoxia to cultured endothelial cells.

Despite large numbers of reported lncRNAs, reference annotations are likely incomplete due to their lower and tighter tissue-specific expression compared to mRNAs. An unexplored factor potentially confounding lncRNA identification is inter-individual expression variability. Here, we characterize lncRNA natural expression variability in human primary granulocytes. Results: We annotate granulocyte lncRNAs and mRNAs in RNA-seq data from ten healthy individuals, identifying multiple lncRNAs absent from reference annotations, and use this to investigate three known features (higher tissue-specificity, lower expression, and reduced splicing efficiency) of lncRNAs relative to mRNAs. Expression variability was examined in seven individuals sampled three times at one or more than one month intervals. We show that lncRNAs display significantly more inter-individual expression variability compared to mRNAs. We confirm this finding in 2 independent human datasets by analyzing multiple tissues from the GTEx project and lymphoblastoid cell lines from the GEUVADIS project. Using the latter dataset we also show that including more human donors into the transcriptome annotation pipeline allows identification of an increasing number of lncRNAs, but minimally affects mRNA gene number. Conclusions: A comprehensive annotation of lncRNAs is known to require an approach that is sensitive to low and tight tissue-specific expression. Here we show that increased inter-individual expression variability is an additional general lncRNA feature to consider when creating a comprehensive annotation of human lncRNAs or proposing their use as prognostic or disease markers."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70390GSE70408	"PAF1, a molecular regulator of promoter-proximal pausing by RNA Polymerase II"	"The control of promoter-proximal pausing and the release of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is a widely used mechanism for regulating gene expression in metazoans, especially for genes that respond to environmental and developmental cues. Here, we identify Pol II associated Factor 1 (PAF1) as a major regulator of promoter-proximal pausing. Knockdown of PAF1 leads to increased release of paused Pol II into gene bodies at thousands of genes. Genes with the highest levels of paused Pol II exhibit the largest redistribution of Pol II from the promoter-proximal region into the gene body in the absence of PAF1. PAF1 depletion results in increased nascent transcription and increased levels of phosphorylation of Pol IIs c-terminal domain on serine 2 (Ser2P). These changes can be explained by the recruitment of the Ser2P kinase Super Elongation Complex (SEC) effecting increased release of paused Pol II into productive elongation, thus establishing a novel function for PAF1 as a major regulator of pausing in metazoans."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70408GSE70503	Transcriptomic variation of pharmacogenes in multiple human tissues and lymphoblastoid cell lines	"Variation in the expression level and activity of genes involved in drug disposition and action (pharmacogenes) can affect drug response and toxicity, especially when in tissues of pharmacological importance.

The post-transcriptional mechanisms guiding HSPC fate during ex vivo expansion have not been closely investigated. Using shRNA-mediated knockdown, we show that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Musashi-2 (MSI2) is required for human HSPC self-renewal. Conversely, when overexpressed, MSI2 induces multiple pro-self-renewal phenotypes, including significant ex vivo expansion of short- and long-term repopulating cells through direct attenuation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Using a global analysis of MSI2-RNA interactions, we determined that MSI2 post-transcriptionally downregulates canonical AHR pathway components in cord blood HSPCs. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into RBP-controlled RNA networks that underlie the self-renewal process and provides evidence that manipulating such networks can provide a novel means to enhance the regenerative potential of human HSPCs expanded ex vivo."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70685GSE70751	Enhancer divergence and cis-regulatory evolution in the human and chimpanzee neural crest	"Here we derive human and chimpanzee cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) and profile histone modifications, transcription factors, chromatin accessibility and gene expression to systematically and quantitatively annotate evolutionary divergence of craniofacial cis-regulatory landscapes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70751GSE70764	Comparative analyses of CTCF and BORIS occupancies uncover two distinct classes of CTCF binding genomic regions	"CTCF and BORIS (CTCFL), two paralogous mammalian proteins sharing nearly identical DNA binding domains, are thought to function in mutually exclusive manners in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Here we show that these two proteins co-occupy a specific subset of regulatory elements consisting of clustered CTCF binding motifs (termed 2xCTSes). BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. In contrast to the single-motif CTCF target sites (1xCTSes), the 2xCTS elements are preferentially found at active promoters and enhancers, both in cancer and germ cells. 2xCTSes are also enriched in genomic regions that escape histone to protamine replacement in human and mouse sperm. Depletion of BORIS gene leads to altered transcription of a large number of genes and the differentiation of K562 cells, while the ectopic expression of this CTCF paralog leads to specific changes in transcription in MCF7 cells. In summary, we discover two functionally and structurally different classes of CTCF binding regions, 2xCTSes and 1xCTSes, revealed by their predisposition to bind BORIS. We propose that 2xCTSes play key roles in the transcriptional program of cancer and germ cells"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70764GSE70767	Deregulation of HIF-Responsive Demethylases Causes Synthetic Lethality Between the VHL Tumor Suppressor Gene and the EZH1 Histone Methyltransferase	Comparison of ccRCC cells with high HIF or low HIF activity	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70767GSE70785	Differentially Expressed Pseudogenes in HIV-1 Infection	We analyzed transcriptomic data from infected and uninfected T-cells to identify pseudogenes and their parent genes showing differential expression in HIV-1 infection	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70785GSE70803	Total RNA profiles associated with DDX3 wild-type (WT) or R534H variant expression with or without sodium arsenite treatment [RNA-seq]	RNA expression profiles are not significantly altered by DDX3 WT or R534H expression as well as by 45 minute exposure of cells to sodium arsenite.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70803GSE70830	Gene expression and splicing alterations analyzed by high throughput RNA sequencing of chronic lymphocytic leukemia specimens	"Background: To determine differentially expressed and spliced RNA transcripts in chronic lymphocytic leukemia specimens a high throughput RNA-sequencing (HTS RNA-seq) analysis was performed. Methods: Ten CLL specimens and five normal peripheral blood CD19+ B cells were analyzed by HTS RNA-seq. The library preparation was performed with Illumina TrueSeq RNA kit and analyzed by Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing system. Results: An average of 48.5 million reads for B cells, and 50.6 million reads for CLL specimens were obtained with 10396 and 10448 assembled transcripts for normal B cells and primary CLL specimens respectively. With the Cuffdiff analysis, 2091 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between B cells and CLL specimens based on FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads and false discovery rate, FDR q<0.05, fold change >2) were identified. Expression of selected DEGs (n=32) with up regulated and down regulated expression in CLL from RNA-seq data were also analyzed by qRT-PCR in a test cohort of CLL specimens. Even though there was a variation in fold expression of DEG genes between RNA-seq and qRT-PCR; more than 90%% of analyzed genes were validated by qRT-PCR analysis. Analysis of RNA-seq data for splicing alterations in CLL and B cells was performed by Multivariate Analysis of Transcript Splicing (MATS analysis). Skipped exon was the most frequent splicing alteration in CLL specimens with 128 significant events (P-value <0.05, minimum inclusion level difference >0.1). Conclusion: The RNA-seq analysis of CLL specimens identifies novel DEG and alternatively spliced genes that are potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. High level of validation by qRT-PCR for a number of DEG genes supports the accuracy of this analysis. Global comparison of transcriptomes of B cells, IGVH non-mutated CLL (U-CLL) and mutated CLL specimens (M-CLL) with multidimensional scaling analysis was able to segregate CLL and B cell transcriptomes but the M-CLL and U-CLL transcriptomes were indistinguishable. The analysis of HTS RNA-seq data to identify alternative splicing events and other genetic abnormalities specific to CLL is an added advantage of RNA-seq that is not feasible with other genome wide analysis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70830GSE70831	MiR-26 dampens IL-6 production by down-regulating TNF-a/NF-kB signaling through silencing HMGA1 and MALT1 and not by directly targeting IL-6 mRNA	We found NF-kB signaling as a major target of miR-26 based on an analysis of the changes in gene activation by TNF-a in response to alteration of miR-26 levels.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70831GSE70833	HCT116 MYC 3' TBE1 (WT) and KO RNA-Seq	mRNA was sequenced from HCT116 MYC 3' TBE1 (WT) and KO cells to identify genes differentially expressed after deletion of the MYC 3' TBE1	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70833GSE70868	The oncogenic BRD4-NUT chromatin regulator drives aberrant transcription within large topological domains	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70868GSE70926	Direct in vivo evidence for B-cell receptor and NF-KB activation in mantle cell lymphoma: role of the lymph node microenvironment and activating mutations.

To investigate the potential role of CYFIP1, a gene within the locus, we carried out knockdown experiments in human neural progenitor cells derived from 15q11.2 neutral induced pluripotent stem cells. Transcriptional profiling and cellular assays support a prominent role for CYFIP1 in cytoskeletal remodeling across all lines examined. Validating the utility of this model for study of disease, genes implicated in schizophrenia and epilepsy but not other disorders or traits unrelated to the deletion, were enriched among mRNAs dysregulated following knockdown. Importantly, and consistent with the variable expressivity of 15q11.2 deletions, the magnitude of disease-related effects varied between donor lines. Towards mechanisms, FMRP targets and synaptic genes were overrepresented among dysregulated mRNAs and as such may contribute to the schizophrenia and epilepsy effects we observe. Further model validation, and new candidate epilepsy genes, comes from machine-learning analyses showing a striking similarity between a subset of dysregulated transcripts and well-established epilepsy genes. Results provide support for an important contribution of CYFIP1 in 15q11.2 mediated risk for NDDs and demonstrate that disease-related biological signatures are evident prior to neuronal differentiation. This new human model of disease will be useful in identifying compounds that could ameliorate outcomes in deletion carriers."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70935GSE70968	RNA-seq profiling of lung adenocarcinoma and paired normal tissue	"To analyze transcriptome data for the mouse xenograft cells derived from a human lung adenocarcinoma patient, reference RNA-seq data were generated for the tracking of gene expression changes associated with the xeno-engraftment and culture."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70968GSE71012	LIN28A modulates splicing and gene expression programs in breast cancer cells [RNA-Seq]	"The goals of this study were to identify LIN28 downstream gene targets in breast cancer cells. We use a subclone of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, MCF-7M as our model system. Methods: mRNA profiles from MCF-7M breast cancer cells treated with siRNA against non-targeting control (NT), LIN28, hnRNP A1, LIN28 and hnRNPA1 (LIN28A1) for 72 hrs were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: BurrowsWheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRTPCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped over 200 million sequence reads per sample to the human genome (build h19). Each of the four groups had two biological replicates. We developed a custom method to identify alternative splicing events and identified 111 genes with significant (FDR<0.05) differential splicing for LIN28 depleted cells compared to non-targeting siRNA control, as well as 249 and 182 genes for hnRNP A1 and LIN28A1 respectively. RNA-seq data were validated with by qRTPCR analysis of a subset of genes. Conclusions: Results reveal that LIN28 regulates alternative splicing and steady state mRNA expression of genes implicated in aspects of breast cancer biology. Notably, cells lacking LIN28 undergo significant isoform switching of the ENAH gene, resulting in a decrease in the expression of ENAH exon 11a isoform.

Here we report that the let-7 biogenesis inhibitor LIN28B correlates with MYC expression in MM and is associated with adverse outcome. We also demonstrate that the LIN28B/let-7 axis modulates the expression of MYC, itself a let-7 target. Further, perturbation of the axis regulates the proliferation of MM cells in vivo in a xenograft tumor model. RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analyses of CRISPR-engineered cells further suggest that the LIN28/let-7 axis regulates MYC and cell cycle pathways in MM. We provide proof-of-principle for therapeutic regulation of MYC through let-7 with an LNA-GapmeR containing a let-7b mimic in vivo, demonstrating that high levels of let-7 expression repress tumor growth by regulating MYC expression.

Endothelial cells respond to FSS thanks to mechanotransduction. However, how the resulting signaling is integrated and resolved at the epigenetic level, remains elusive. We hypothesized that Polycomb methyltransferase EZH2 is involved in the effects of FSS in human endothelial cells. We showed that FSS decreases the expression of the Polycomb methyltransferase EZH2. Despite simultaneous activation of MAPK7, MAPK7 pathway does not directly influence the transcription of EZH2. Interestingly though, the knock down of EZH2 activates the protective MAPK7 signaling in endothelial cells, even in the absence of FSS. To understand the influence of the FSS-decreased expression of EZH2 on endothelial transcriptome, we performed RNA-seq and differential gene expression analysis. We identified candidate groups of genes dependent on both EZH2 and FSS. Among those, Gene Ontology overrepresentation analysis revealed highly significant enrichment of the cell cycle-related genes, suggesting changes in proliferation. Indeed, the depletion of EZH2 strongly inhibited endothelial proliferation, indicating cell cycle arrest. The concomitant decrease in CCNA expression suggests the transition of endothelial cells into a quiescent phenotype. Further bioinformatical analysis suggested TXNIP as a possible mediator between EZH2 and cell cycle-related gene network. Our data show that EZH2 is a FSS-responsive gene. Decreased EZH2 levels enhance the activation of the atheroprotective MAPK7 signaling. Decrease in EZH2 under FSS mediates the decrease in the expression of the network of cell cycle-related genes, which allows the cells to enter quiescence. EZH2 is therefore important for the protective effects of FSS in endothelium."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71164GSE71191	mRNA-Seq reads aligned to HTT in hg38/GENCODEv21	"Despite 20 years since its discovery, the gene responsible for Huntingtons Disease, HTT, has still not had its function or transcriptional profile completely characterized.

Because stimulation of mammary cells with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) leads to dynamic changes in the abundance of both coding and non-coding RNA molecules, and culminates in the acquisition of a robust migratory phenotype, this cellular model might disclose functions of circRNAs. Here we show that circRNAs of EGF-stimulated mammary cells are stably expressed, while mRNAs and micro-RNAs change within minutes. In general, the circRNAs we detected are relatively long-lived and weakly expressed. Interestingly, they are almost ubiquitously co-expressed with the corresponding linear transcripts, and the respective, shared promoter regions are more active compared to genes producing linear isoforms only. These findings imply that altered abundance of circRNAs, unlike changes in the levels of other RNAs, might not play critical roles in signaling cascades and downstream transcriptional networks that rapidly commit cells to specific outcomes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71195GSE71203	Transcriptome analysis of RANK-positive and RANK-negative luminal progenitor subpopulations in the human breast	RANK-positive and RANK-negative luminal progenitor cells were isolated by FACS from histologically normal human breast tissue from wild-type human donors.

However, the function of miRNAs in human brain development remains largely unexplored. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression of regionalized neural progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells and human fetal brain. We found mir-92b-3p and mir-130b-5p to be specifically associated with neural progenitors and several miRNAs that display both age-specific and region-specific expression patterns. Among these miRNAs, we identified miR-10 to be specifically expressed in the human hindbrain and spinal cord, while absent from rostral regions. We found that miR-10 regulates a large number of genes enriched for functions including transcription, actin cytoskeleton and ephrin receptor signaling. When overexpressed, miR-10 influences caudalization of human neural progenitors cells. Together, these data confirms a role for miRNAs in establishing different human neural progenitor populations.

Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and -globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters, and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. The findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by genome sequence."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71275GSE71284	Truncation of LOC100288798 (SLC38A4-AS) lncRNA in human haploid KBM7 cell line	"Many thousand long non-coding (lnc) RNAs are mapped in the human genome. Time consuming studies using reverse genetic approaches by post-transcriptional knock-down or genetic modification of the locus demonstrated diverse biological functions for a few of these transcripts. The Human Gene Trap Mutant Collection in haploid KBM7 cells is a ready-to-use tool for studying protein-coding gene function. As lncRNAs show remarkable differences in RNA biology compared to protein-coding genes, it is unclear if this gene trap collection is useful for functional analysis of lncRNAs. Here we use the uncharacterized LOC100288798 lncRNA as a model to answer this question. Using public RNA-seq data we show that LOC100288798 is ubiquitously expressed, but inefficiently spliced. The minor spliced LOC100288798 isoforms are exported to the cytoplasm, whereas the major unspliced isoform is nuclear localized. This shows that LOC100288798 RNA biology differs markedly from typical mRNAs. De novo assembly from RNA-seq data suggests that LOC100288798 extends 289kb beyond its annotated 3' end and overlaps the downstream SLC38A4 gene. Three cell lines with independent gene trap insertions in LOC100288798 were available from the KBM7 gene trap collection. RT-qPCR and RNA-seq confirmed successful lncRNA truncation and its extended length. Expression analysis from RNA-seq data shows significant deregulation of 41 protein-coding genes upon LOC100288798 truncation. Our data shows that gene trap collections in human haploid cell lines are useful tools to study lncRNAs, and identifies the previously uncharacterized LOC100288798 as a potential gene regulator."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71284GSE71289	Transcriptome profiling of human neural progenitor cells and neurons with DISC1 interruption	"Purpose: Genetic and clinical association studies have identified disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) as a candidate risk gene for major mental illness. DISC1 is interrupted by a balanced chr(1;11) translocation in a Scottish family, in which the translocation predisposes to psychiatric disorders. We investigate the consequences of DISC1 interruption in human neural cells using TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9 to target the DISC1 locus. We sought to compare the gene expression profiles of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons with interruption of the DISC1 gene in exon 2 (affecting all known coding transcripts) or exon 8 (near the site of the Scottish translocation, affecting longer transcripts). Methods: Wild-type and DISC1-targeted iPSCs (wild-type = 'WT', exon 8 single allelic frameshift mutant = 'ex8_wm', exon 8 biallelic frameshift mutant = 'ex8_mm', exon 2 biallelic frameshift mutant = 'ex2mm') were differentiated to NPCs and neurons using an embryoid aggregate method. NPC or neuronal cultures were used for RNA harvest and subsequent paired-end stranded sequencing of >50M reads/sample and 3-6 biological replicates per group. Results: We find that a subset of genes related to neuronal differentiation and development are dysregulated with DISC1 disruption at the NPC timepoint, whereas expression of genes related to neuronal function and signaling are altered at the neuronal timepoint.

Mutations in SRSF2 are frequently found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and certain leukemias, but how they affect SRSF2 function has only begun to be examined. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce the P95H mutation to SRSF2 in K562 leukemia cells, generating an isogenic model so that splicing alterations can be attributed solely to mutant SRSF2. We found that SRSF2 (P95H) misregulates 548 splicing events (<1%% of total). Of these, 374 involve the inclusion of cassette exons, and the inclusion was either increased (206) or decreased (168). We detected a specific motif (UCCA/UG) enriched in the more included exons and a distinct motif (UGGA/UG) in the more excluded exons. RNA gel shift assays showed that a mutant SRSF2 derivative bound more tightly than its wild-type counterpart to RNA sites containing UCCAG, but less tightly to UGGAG sites. The pattern of exon inclusion or exclusion thus correlated in most cases with stronger or weaker RNA binding, respectively. We further show that the P95H mutation does not affect other functions of SRSF2, i.e., protein-protein interactions with key splicing factors. Our results thus demonstrate that the P95H mutation positively or negatively alters the binding affinity of SRSF2 for cognate RNA sites in target transcripts, leading to misregulation of exon inclusion. Our findings not only shed light on the mechanism of the disease-associated SRSF2 mutation in splicing regulation, but also reveal a group of mis-spliced mRNA isoforms for potential therapeutic targeting."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71299GSE71318	Tracing the expression of circular RNAs in human preimplantation embryos	We systematically analyzed transcriptome in individual human oocytes and preimplantation embryos with a new single-cell RNA seq method we recently developed.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71318GSE71325	A Surveillance System of Active Enhancers by a RACK7-histone Demethylase Complex (RNA-Seq I)	"Primed enhancers are marked by histone H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1), and the conversion to active enhancers involves acetylation of histone H3K27 (H3K27Ac).

Here, we report that tumor hypoxia reduces the activity of oxygen-dependent TET enzymes, which catalyze DNA de-methylation through 5-methylcytosine oxidation. This occurs independently of hypoxia-associated alterations in TET gene expression, basal metabolism, HIF activity or nuclear reactive oxygen species, but directly depends on oxygen shortage. Hypoxia-induced loss of TET activity increases hypermethylation at gene promoters in vitro, while also in patients, gene promoters are markedly more methylated in hypoxic than normoxic tumors. Affected genes are frequently involved in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis and metastasis, indicating cellular selection of hypermethylation events. Overall, up to 50%% of the tumor-associated hypermethylation is ascribable to hypoxia across various cancer types. Accordingly, spontaneous murine breast tumors become hypermethylated when rendered hypoxic through vessel pruning, whereas vessel normalisation rescues this effect. Tumor hypoxia thus acts as a novel regulator underlying DNA methylation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71401GSE71414	Complete hematologic response of early-T-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia to the gamma-secretase inhibitor BMS-906024: genetic and epigenetic findings in an outlier case	"Notch pathway antagonists such as gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) are being tested in diverse cancers, but exceptional responses have yet to be reported. We describe the case of a patient with relapsed/refractory early-T-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) who achieved a complete hematologic response following treatment with the GSI BMS-906024. Whole exome sequencing of leukemic blasts revealed heterozygous gain-of-function driver mutations in NOTCH1, CSF3R, and PTPN11, and a homozygous/hemizygous loss-of-function mutation in DNMT3A. The three gain-of-function mutations were absent from remission marrow cells, but the DNMT3A mutation persisted in heterozygous form in remission marrow, consistent with an origin for the patients ETP-ALL from clonal hematopoiesis. Ex vivo culture of ETP-ALL blasts confirmed high levels of activated NOTCH1 that were repressed by GSI treatment, and RNA-Seq documented that GSI downregulated multiple known Notch target genes. Surprisingly, one potential target gene that was unaffected by GSI was MYC, a key Notch target in GSI-sensitive T-ALL of cortical T cell type. H3K27ac superenhancer landscapes near MYC showed a pattern previously reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is sensitive to BRD4 inhibitors, and in line with this ETP-ALL blasts downregulated MYC in response to the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1. To our knowledge, this is the first example of complete response of a Notch-mutated ETP-ALL to a Notch antagonist and is also the first description of chromatin landscapes associated with ETP-ALL. Our experience suggests that additional attempts to target Notch in Notch-mutated ETP-ALL are merited."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71414GSE71421	EHMT1 and EHMT2 inhibition induce fetal hemoglobin expression [RNA-seq]	Using UNC0638 and genetic assays to inhibit EHMT1/2 and derepress fetal hemoglobin in adult hematopoietic cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71421GSE71446	Genome-wide Analysis of Human Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR) Transcriptome in Wild-type and CAR-knockout HepaRG cells	"The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) modulates the transcription of numerous genes involving drug metabolism, energy homeostasis, and cell proliferation. Most functions of CAR however were defined from animal studies. Given the known species difference of CAR and the significant cross-talk between CAR and the pregnane X receptor (PXR), it is extremely difficult to decipher the exact role of human CAR (hCAR) in gene regulation, relying predominantly on pharmacological manipulations. Here, utilizing a newly generated hCAR-knockout (KO) HepaRG cell line, we carried out RNA-seq analysis of the global transcriptomes in wild-type (WT) and hCAR-KO HepaRG cells treated with CITCO, a selective hCAR agonist, phenobarbital (PB), a dual activator of hCAR and hPXR, or vehicle control. Real-time PCR assays in separate experiments were used to validate RNA-seq findings. Our results indicate that genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes are among the main clusters altered by both CITCO and PB. Specifically, CITCO significantly changed the expression of 135 genes in an hCAR-dependent manner, while PB altered the expression of 227 genes in WT cells of which 94 were simultaneously modulated in both cell lines reflecting the dual effects of PB on hCAR/PXR. Notably, we found that many genes promoting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis were up-regulated in hCAR-KO cells, suggesting that hCAR may play an important role in cell growth that differs from mouse CAR. Together, our results reveal both novel and known targets of hCAR and support the role of hCAR in maintaining the homeostasis of metabolism and cell proliferation in the liver."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71446GSE71458	Derivation and differentiation of haploid human embryonic stem cells	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71458GSE71468	Co-regulation of splicing by Rbfox1 and hnRNP M	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71468GSE71503	SMARCB1-mediated SWI/SNF complex function is essential for enhancer regulation [primary tissue_RNA-seq]	"SMARCB1 (SNF5/INI1/BAF47), a core subunit of the SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex, is inactivated in nearly all pediatric rhabdoid tumors.

Although ARID1A is the most frequent target of mutations, the mechanism by which its inactivation promotes tumorigenesis is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Arid1a functions as a tumor suppressor in the mouse colon, but not the small intestine, and that invasive ARID1A-deficient adenocarcinomas resemble human colorectal cancer (CRC). These tumors lack deregulation of APC/beta-catenin, crucial gatekeepers in common forms of intestinal cancer. ARID1A normally targets SWI/SNF complexes to enhancers, where they function in coordination with transcription factors (TFs) to facilitate gene activation. ARID1B preserves SWI/SNF function in ARID1A-deficient cells, but defects in SWI/SNF targeting and control of enhancer activity cause extensive dysregulation of gene expression. These findings represent an advance in colon cancer modeling and implicate enhancer-mediated gene regulation as a principal tumor suppressor function of ARID1A."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71511GSE71519	"Synergistic gene expression signature observed in TK6 cells upon co-exposure to UVC-irradiation and protein kinase C-activating tumor promoters, a time course study (study 1/2)"	"The purpose of this study, including this time course series and another dosage series, was to establish gene expression signatures representing the interaction of pathways deregulated by tumor promoting agents and pathways induced by DNA damage.

Fusions of the nuclease-inactive dCas9 to the KRAB repressor domain (dCas9-KRAB) can effectively silence target gene expression. We targeted dCas9-KRAB to the HS2 enhancer, a distal regulatory element that orchestrates the expression of multiple globin genes. Genome-wide analyses demonstrated that localization of dCas9-KRAB to HS2 specifically induced H3K9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) at that enhancer and reduced the chromatin accessibility of both the enhancer and its promoter targets. Targeted epigenetic modification of HS2 silenced the expression of multiple globin genes, with minimal off-target changes in gene expression. These results demonstrate that repression mediated by dCas9-KRAB is sufficiently specific to disrupt the activity of individual enhancers via local modification of the epigenome.

Splice site specification and activity are controlled by interactions of cis-acting determinants on a transcript with specific RNA binding proteins. A major subset of these interactions comprises interactions localized to the intronic U-rich polypyrimidine tract located immediately 5 to the majority of splice acceptors. alphaCPs (also referred to as polyC-binding proteins (PCBPs) and hnRNP Es) comprise a subset of KH-domain proteins with high specificity and affinity for C-rich polypyrimidine motifs. Prior studies have revealed that binding of alphaCPs to C-rich motifs can modulate splicing and 3 processing of the human alpha-globin mRNA transcript in the nucleus as well as stabilization of the halpha-globin mRNA in the cytoplasm. In the current report, we demonstrate that alphaCPs have a positive impact on the activity of splice acceptor sites in a defined subset of mammalian transcripts via binding to polypyrimidine tracts that are predominantly C-rich.

In this study, the NGS sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) method was employed to obtain the whole transcriptome of cardiac tissues from transplant recipients with advanced stage of HF. The analysis of RNA-Seq data presents novel challenges and many methods have been developed for the purpose of mapping reads to genomic features and quantifying gene expression. The main goal of this work was to identify, characterize and catalogue all the transcripts expressed within cardiac tissue and to quantify the differential expression of transcripts in both physio- and pathological conditions through whole transcriptome analyses. Expression levels, differential splicing, allele-specific expression, RNA editing and fusion transcripts constitute important information when comparing samples for disease related studies. Analysis methods for RNA-Seq data are continuing to evolve. Thus, in order to find the best solution for filter generated list of differentially expressed genes, an informatic approach of NOISeq BIO method has been applied in this RNA-Seq analysis.

Here, using somatic cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from DC patients with PARN mutations, we show that PARN is required for the 3 end maturation of the telomerase RNA component (TERC). Patient cells as well as immortalized cells in which PARN is disrupted show decreased levels of TERC. Deep sequencing of TERC RNA 3 termini reveals that PARN is required for removal of posttranscriptionally acquired oligo(A) tails that target nuclear RNAs for degradation. Diminished TERC levels and the increased oligo(A) forms of TERC are normalized by restoring PARN, which is limiting for TERC maturation in cells.

Using this approach, we detected > 350 pre-miRNAs in human cells and > 250 pre-miRNAs in a reanalysis of a similar study in mouse cells. We uncovered widespread trimming and non-templated additions to 3 ends of pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs. Additionally, we identified novel AGO2-cleaved pre-miRNAs and created an index for microRNA precursor processing efficiency. This analysis revealed a subset of pre-miRNAs that produce low levels of mature miRNAs despite abundant precursors, including an annotated miRNA in the 5 UTR of the DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (Dgcr8) mRNA transcript. This led us to search for other AGO-associated stem-loops originating from other mRNA species, which identified hundreds of putative pre-miRNAs derived from mRNA sequences in both the mouse and human transcriptomes. Intriguingly, we found that iron responsive elements in ferritin heavy and light chain mRNAs are processed into AGO-associated stem-loops in both mouse and humans but do not produce functional small RNAs.

However, epigenetic alterations, in the form of aberrant DNA methylation patterns, are also abundant. Using MIRA-seq, we have carried out a comprehensive characterization of the DNA methylome in a series of metastatic melanoma samples and catalogued the methylation changes relative to normal melanocytes, the presumed cells of origin for these tumors. Individual melanoma tumors contained up to several thousand hypermethylated regions. We discovered 179 tumor-specific methylation peaks that were present in all (27/27) melanomas and may lend themselves as effective disease biomarkers, and 3124 methylation peaks were present in >40%% of the tumors. We specifically examined the relationship between presence of the Polycomb mark, H3K27me3 in melanocytes and tumor-specific DNA methylation in melanoma. We found that 150 of the approximately 1,200 tumor-associated methylation peaks near transcription start sites (TSS) were H3K27me3-marked in melanocytes. Notably, DNA methylation in melanoma was specific for distinct H3K27me3 peaks rather than for H3K27me3-enriched regions with broad genomic coverage. Yet, there were also numerous H3K27me3 peak-associated TSS regions that were completely resistant to DNA methylation in tumors. Furthermore, a rather large group of genes became methylated in melanoma but lacked H3K27me3 in melanocytes. There was no relationship between presence of BRAF V600 mutations and the number of methylation peaks in individual tumors. Gene expression analysis showed a strong signature of upregulated immune response genes in melanomas presumably as a result of lymphocyte infiltration. Genes down-regulated in tumors were enriched for melanocyte differentiation and pigmentation factors. Overall, there was limited correlation between tumor-associated DNA methylation changes and changes in gene expression although distinct melanocyte differentiation genes including KIT, PAX3 and SOX10 became methylated and downregulated in melanoma."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71747GSE71756	"microRNA suppresses prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis by inhibiting a cohort of pro-metastasis targets including CD44, Rho GTPases and EZH2"	"microRNA plays important roles in tumor initiation and progression.

Consequently, targeted therapies against DOT1L and BRD4 are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. However, the mechanisms by which BRD4 and DOT1L regulate leukaemogenic transcription programs remain unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, chemoproteomics and biochemical fractionation we find that native BRD4 and DOT1L exist in largely separate protein complexes. Genetic disruption or small molecule inhibition of BRD4 and DOT1L shows marked synergistic activity against MLL-FP leukaemia cell lines, primary human leukaemia cells and murine leukaemia models. Mechanistically, we find a previously unrecognised functional collaboration between DOT1L and BRD4 that is especially important at highly transcribed genes in close proximity to superenhancers. DOT1L via H3K79me2 facilitates the deposition of histone H4 acetylation, which in turn regulates the binding of BRD4 to chromatin. These data provide novel insights into the regulation of transcription and specify a molecular framework for therapeutic intervention in this poor prognostic disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71777GSE71831	Deletion of DXZ4 on the human inactive X chromosome eliminates superdomains and impairs gene silencing	"During interphase, the inactive X chromosome (Xi) adopts an unusual 3D configuration known as the Barr body and is largely transcriptionally silent. Despite the importance of X inactivation, little is known about the 3D configuration of Xi and its relationship to gene silencing. We recently showed that in humans, Xi exhibits two distinctive structural features. First, Xi is partitioned into two huge intervals, called superdomains, such that pairs of loci in each superdomain show an enhanced contact frequency with one another. The boundary between the two superdomains lies near DXZ4, a macrosatellite repeat spanning ~300kb, whose Xi allele extensively binds the protein CTCF. Second, Xi exhibits extremely large loops, up to 77Mb long, called superloops. DXZ4 lies at the anchor of several superloops. Here, we use 3D mapping to study the structure of Xi, focusing on the role of DXZ4. We show that superloops and superdomains are conserved across mammals. We develop a novel variant of our in situ Hi-C protocol, dubbed COLA (COncatemer Ligation Assay) to probe the higher order structures formed by the superloops. In COLA, in situ proximity ligation of multiple extremely short fragments produced by the enzyme CviJI is used to efficiently map simultaneous proximity among three or more loci. Using data from Hi-C and COLA, we demonstrate that DXZ4 and other superloop anchors tend to co-locate simultaneously within the same cells, a result that is confirmed by 3D-FISH. Finally, we examine the effects of deleting DXZ4 from Xi in human cells. Using in situ Hi-C, microscopy, and RNA-FISH, we show that superdomains and superloops disappear; that Xi frequently dissociates into multiple separate structures; and that transcriptional silencing on Xi is compromised. Deletion of DXZ4 from the active X chromosome (Xa) has no such effect. Thus, DXZ4 is essential for proper folding and silencing of Xi."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71831GSE71854	ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis of KMT2D-silenced metastatic melanoma cells	"Purpose: Study of the mechanism trough which KTM2D regulates chromatin modification and transcription in a xenograft model of human metatstatic melanoma Methods: We generated patient derived xenografts (PDXs) from metastatic melanoma (MM) biopsies of three different patients. The MMs carry NRASQ61L, NRASQ61Q or BRAFV600 mutations. Cells from secondary PDX (PDX2) were transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying Luciferase (shLuc) and KMT2D (shKMT2D) hairpins and mRNA profiles and genome-wide chromatin-state maps were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000.

These progenitors have been difficult to profile with unbiased transcriptomics since progenitors-particularly radial glia (RG)-are rare cell types, defined by a combination of intracellular markers, position and morphology. To circumvent these problems, we developed a method called FRSCR for transcriptome profiling of individual fixed, stained, and sorted cells. After validation of FRSCR with human embryonic stem cells, we profiled primary human RG that constitute only 1%% of the mid-gestation cortex. These data showed that RG could be classified into ventricle zone-enriched RG (vRG) that expressed ANXA1 and CRYAB, and outer subventricular zone-localized RG (oRG) that expressed HOPX. Our study identified the first markers and molecular profiles of vRG and oRG cells, and provides an essential step for understanding molecular networks that control the development and lineage of human neocortical progenitors. Furthermore, FRSCR allows targeted single-cell transcriptomic profiling of many tissues that currently lack live-cell markers."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71858GSE71878	Transcript abundance in A-T-derived iPSC: Comparing isogenic cells to unrelated individual	"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were prepared from multiple subjects with Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). iPSC were prepared from activated T-cells using commercial Sendai virus to deliver reprogramming factors. ATM protein-expressing and non-expressing cultures would found in multiple sub-lines (sub-lines are generated from distinct founder colonies of cells) from a single subject (Q3). Genetic analysis determined that all sub-lines originated from the same subject and were likely the product of spontaneous reversion by gene correction. To compare gene expression profiles, three iPSC samples were assayed: (1) A reverted ATM+/- subline from subject Q3, (2) An ATM-/- subline from subject Q3, and (3) An iPSC line from an unrelated ATM-/- subject, Q1. Analysis reveals that the majority of significantly-different genes between the unrelated ATM-/- line (Q1SA) and the reverted ATM+/- line (Q3SC) was due to genetic variation between individuals. A more focused set of contrasting genes could be identified between the isogenic Q3-derived lines (Q3SA, ATM-/-, vs. Q3SC, ATM+/-).

"The epigenetic regulator BMI1 is upregulated in many human malignancies and has been implicated in cell migration, but the impact on autochthonous tumor progression is unexplored. Our analyses of human expression data show that BMI1 levels increase with progression in melanoma. We find that BMI1 expression in melanoma cells does not influence cell proliferation or primary tumor growth. In contrast, BMI1 levels are a key determinant of melanoma metastasis, whereby deletion impairs and overexpression enhances dissemination. Remarkably, BMI1s pro-metastatic effect reflects enhancement of all stages of the metastatic cascade including invasion, migration, extravasation, adhesion and survival. Additionally, downregulation or upregulation of BMI1 induces sensitivity or resistance to BRAF inhibitor. Consistent with these pleiotropic effects, we find that BMI1 promotes widespread gene expression changes that encompass key hallmarks of the melanoma invasive signature, including activation of TGF, non-canonical Wnt, EMT and EGF/PDGF pathways. Importantly, for both primary and metastatic melanoma samples, this BMI1-induced signature identifies invasive subclasses of human melanoma and predicts poor patient outcome. Our data yield key insights into melanoma biology and establish BMI1 as a compelling drug target whose inhibition would suppress both metastasis and chemoresistance."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71890GSE71900	AKT Inhibition Promotes Non-autonomous Cancer Cell Survival [RNA-Seq]	"Small-molecule inhibitors of AKT signaling are being in evaluated in patients with various cancer types, but have so far proven therapeutically disappointing for reasons that remain unclear. Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this AKTlow cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71900GSE71960	Research resource: global identification of estrogen receptor  target genes in triple negative breast cancer cells	The goal of this work was to identify all estrogen receptor beta target genes using RNA sequencing in MDA-MB-468 triple negative breast cancer cells engineered with inducible expression of full length estrogen receptor beta.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71960GSE71972	Histamine footprint on the human exercise transcriptome	"Transcriptome wide analysis of the skeletal muscle response to exercise in humans.

However, ChIP-seq is limited by the availability of suitable ChIP-seq grade antibodies, and the vast majority of commercially available antibodies fail to generate usable datasets. To ameliorate these technical obstacles, we present a robust methodological approach for performing ChIP-seq through epitope tagging of endogenous TFs. We used Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based genome editing technology to develop CRISPR Epitope Tagging ChIP-seq (CETCh-seq) of DNA-binding proteins. We assessed the feasibility of CETCh-seq by tagging several TFs spanning a wide range of endogenous expression levels in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Our data exhibit strong correlations between both replicate types as well as with standard ChIP-seq approaches that use TF antibodies. Notably, we also observed minimal changes to the cellular transcriptome and to the expression of the tagged TF. To examine the robustness of our technique, we further performed CETCh-seq in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 as well as mouse embryonic stem cells and observed similarly high correlations. Collectively, these data highlight the applicability of CETCh-seq to accurately define the genome-wide binding profiles of DNA-binding proteins, allowing for a straightforward methodology to potentially assay the complete repertoire of TFs, including the large fraction for which ChIPquality antibodies are not available."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72082GSE72131	Genome-wide map of H3K4me3 before and after methionine restriction in HCT116 cells.

One potential pioneer factor, GATA3, is a critical component for multiple cellular programs. GATA3 is of particular interest as it regulates gene expression in breast cancers, and low expression correlates with poor prognosis. Here we demonstrate the pioneering activity of GATA3 utilizing a cellular reprogramming system (the mesenchymal-epithelial transition) in breast cancer cells. During the epithelial transition, GATA3 catalyzes chromatin reprogramming by inducing chromatin opening, active enhancer modifications, and nucleosome remodelling. We determined that the transactivation domain is required for this chromatin reprogramming. Importantly, a mutant lacking the transactivation domain possessed the chromatin binding ability but failed to create open chromatin, suggesting binding alone is not sufficient to induce open chromatin. These data illustrate a fundamental mechanism of GATA3-mediated gene regulation, and provide evidence for a pre-engagement state of closed chromatin bound by a pioneer factor."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72141GSE72156	Global analysis of pre-mRNA subcellular localization upon splicing inhibition by spliceostatin A	RNA-Seq analysis of SSA treated cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72156GSE72202	RNA-seq Profiles in Preferential Iron Trafficking Characterizes Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells	"Glioblastomas display hierarchies with self-renewing cancer stem-like cells (CSCs).

Direct interrogation of iron uptake demonstrated CSCs potently extract iron from the microenvironment more effectively than other tumor cells. Systematic interrogation of iron flux determined that CSCs preferentially require transferrin receptor and ferritin - two core iron regulators - to propagate and form tumors in vivo. Depleting ferritin disrupted CSC mitotic progression, through the STAT3-FoxM1 regulatory axis, revealing an iron-regulated CSC pathway.

This latent reservoir is recalcitrant to antiretroviral therapy (ART) making lifelong treatment the only option for patients. The shock and kill strategy aims to eradicate latent HIV by reactivating proviral gene expression followed by ART treatment. Gene specific transcriptional activation can be achieved using the RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 system comprising small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with a nuclease deficient Cas9 mutant (dCas9) fused to the VP64 transactivation domain (dCas9-VP64). We engineered this system to target 23 sites within the LTR promoter of HIV-1 and identified a hotspot for activation. We studied the functionality of activating sgRNAs to transcriptionally modulate the latent proviral genome across multiple differentin vitrolatency cell models including several J-Lat, ACH2 J1.1 and the CEM T cell model comprising a single clonal population of integrated mCherry-IRES-Tat from a full-length HIV LTR (LChIT). While we observed variable responses of latent cell models to well-characterized chemical stimuli, we detected consistent efficient activation of latent virus mediated by activator sgRNAs. In addition, transcriptome analysis of chemically treated cells revealed massive non-specific gene dysregulation whereas by comparison, dCas9-VP64/sgRNAs induced specific activation of the integrated provirus. In conclusion, we show the potential for CRISPR-mediated gene activation systems to provide enhanced efficiency and specificity in a targeted latency reactivation strategy.

Initially arising within the central nervous system, NC cells subsequently undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition to migrate into the periphery, where they differentiate into diverse cell types. Here we provide evidence that postnatal human epidermal keratinocytes, in response to FGF2 and IGF1 signals, can be reprogrammed toward a neural crest fate. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses show that keratinocyte-derived NC cells are similar to those derived from human embryonic stem cells. Moreover, they give rise in vitro and in vivo to neural crest derivatives such as peripheral neurons, melanocytes, Schwann cells and mesenchymal cells (osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes and smooth muscle). By demonstrating that human KRT14+ keratinocytes can form neural crest cells, even from clones of single cells, our results have important implications in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72268GSE72299	"Gene expression in TAL1-driven T-cell ALL in response to TAL1-KD, UTX-KD, and GSKJ4 treatment"	"T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) is a heterogeneous group of hematological tumors composed of distinct subtypes that vary in their genetic abnormalities, gene expression signatures and prognoses. However, it remains unclear whether T-ALL subtypes differ at the functional level, and as such T-ALL treatments are uniformly applied across subtypes leading to variable responses between patients. Here we reveal the existence of a subtype-specific epigenetic vulnerability in T-ALL whereby a particular subgroup of T-ALL characterized by expression of the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 is uniquely sensitive to variations in dosage and activity of the histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase UTX. Specifically, we identify UTX as a co-activator of TAL1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UTX, previously described as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL, is in fact a potent oncogene essential for maintaining the leukemic phenotype of TAL1-positive (but not TAL1-negative) T-ALL. Exploiting this subtype-specific epigenetic vulnerability, we designed a novel therapeutic approach based on UTX inhibition through in vivo administration of an H3K27 demethylase inhibitor that is highly effective against TAL1-positive primary human leukemia. These findings provide the first opportunity to develop personalized epigenetic therapy for T-ALL patients."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72299GSE72404	NOTCH1 mediates a reciprocal switch between two distinct secretomes during senescence [N1ICD]	"ER:RAS-G12V expressing IMR90 cells were transduced with N1ICD-containing or control vectors before treatment with either 100nM 4-OHT or vehicle for 6 days leading to Notch-induced senescence (NIS), RAS-induced senescence (RIS) or combined Notch and Ras-induced senescence (RNIS)."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72404GSE72407	NOTCH1 mediates a reciprocal switch between two distinct secretomes during senescence [CSM]	"ER:RAS-G12V expressing IMR90 cells were treated with either 100nM 4-OHT for 6 days or 100uM Etoposide for 2 days, followed by further culture for 5 days, leading to RAS-induced senescence (RIS) and DNA-damage induced senescence (DDIS) respectively."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72407GSE72420	The Ro60 Autoantigen Binds Endogenous Retroelements and Regulates Inflammatory Gene Expression	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72420GSE72460	Transcriptome of human ILC2s; primary vs IL-1b-primed	"ILC2s regulate type2 immune responses and protect against helminth infection.

The most common EGFR mutation, EGFRvIII, sensitizes GBM cells to the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 in a SOX9, FOXG1-dependent manner.

However, the determinants of AR overexpression in CRPC are poorly defined. Here we show that retinoic acid receptorrelated orphan receptor  (ROR-) is overexpressed and amplified in metastatic CRPC tumors, and that ROR- drives AR expression in the tumors. ROR- recruits nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (NCOA1 and NCOA3, also known as SRC-1 and SRC-3) to an ARROR response element (RORE) to stimulate AR gene transcription. ROR- antagonists suppress the expression of both AR and its variant AR-V7 in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and tumors. ROR- antagonists also markedly diminish genome-wide AR binding, H3K27ac abundance and expression of the AR target gene network. Finally, ROR- antagonists suppressed tumor growth in multiple AR-expressing, but not AR-negative, xenograft PCa models, and they effectively sensitized CRPC tumors to enzalutamide, without overt toxicity in mice.

MARGE adopts a gene centric approach to define a regulatory potential that summarizes the aggregate activity of multiple cis-regulatory elements on each gene. This model is effective in describing cis-regulatory activity and, unlike the super-enhancer based approach, is highly predictive of gene expression changes in response to BET-bromodomain inhibitors. We show that linear combinations of H3K27ac defined regulatory potentials, selected from an extensive database of published H3K27ac profiles, can accurately model diverse gene sets derived from differential gene expression experiments. In addition, we demonstrate a novel semi-supervised learning approach for identifying transcription factor binding sites associated with the set of transcription factors that regulate the gene set. MARGE leverages published H3K27ac ChIP-seq data to enhance the interpretation of newly generated H3K27ac ChIP-seq profiles.

"Purpose: Human papilloma virus (HPV) associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has a better prognosis than HPV(-) negative cancer. This may be due, in part, to the higher number of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in HPV(+) tumours. We used RNAseq to evaluate whether these differences in clinical behaviour could be explained simply by a numerical difference in TILs or whether there was a fundamental difference between TILs in these two settings. Patients and methods: Twenty-three consecutive HNSCC cases with high and moderate TIL density were subjected to RNAseq analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between 10 HPV(+) and 13 HPV(-) tumours were identified with EdgeR. Immune subset analysis was performed using, FAIME (Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression) and Immune gene transcript count analysis. Results: 1634 genes were differentially expressed. There was a dominant immune signature in HPV(+) tumours. After normalizing expression profiles for numerical differences in T cells and B cells, 437 significantly DEGs still remained. A B-cell associated signature emerged, which segregated HPV(+) from HPV(-) cancers and included CD200, STAG3, GGA2, SPIB and ADAM28. Differential expression of these genes was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: In our dataset, the difference associated with T-cells between patients with HPV(+) and (-) HNSCC was predominantly numerical.

Herein, we use integrative genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic fine-mapping in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) and tissues to identify causal regulatory variation and mechanisms responsible for CAD associations. Using these genome-wide maps we prioritize 65 candidate variants and perform allele-specific binding and expression analyses on 7 top candidates.

It releases placental hormones and plays a primary role in exchange of gases, nutrients and waste products. Alterations in STB development and turnover have been implicated in placental diseases, including preeclampsia (PE). In vitro cell models are badly needed to study STB development and physiology due to inaccessibility to placental tissues during gestation. To establish in vitro STB model system, we generate STB and its mononucleated precursors from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and profile for RNA content by RNAseq. Methods: H1 Human ESC (WA01) were treated with BMP4, the ALK4/5/7 inhibitor (A83-01), and the FGF2 signaling inhibitor (PD173074) (BAP) to direct them to the trophoblast lineage and provided both STB and extravillous trophoblast. Syncytial areas emerged at day 8 BAP treatment ranged in diameter from ~40 m to > 100 m. The intact syncytial areas were isolated by sieving successively through 70 m and 40 m mesh cell strainers. The captured cells are recovered by inverting the strainer and rinsing with culture medium to separate large (>70 m) and middle size cell sheets (40-70 m). The fraction that passes through both sieves represents cells of smallest diameter (< 40 m), presumably cytotrophoblast. Total 12 RNA samples from triplicate three size-fractioned BAP treated and three untreated hESC cultured in a FGF2 supplemented medium in parallel were analyzed. Results: The larger > 70 m areas stained positively for STB markers while ultrastructural analysis clearly revealed multi-nuclear cells with an extensive cytoplasm containing many prominent secretion granules. The larger STB areas also had a larger DNA content that > 70 m fraction contained 37 times more nuclear content and 40-70 m fraction did 16 times more. Compared to the < 40 m cell fraction, these larger cells over-expressed a full repertoire of genes characteristic of STB, e.g. CGA, CGB, PGF, ERVW1, GCM1. The smallest cell fraction had a DNA content consistent with mononuclear diploid cells, contained few secretory granules, and were only weakly positive for STB markers. Conclusion: The data are consistent with the > 70 m cells being mature STB, while the intermediate fraction may represent a precursor population. Human ESC directed along the trophoblast lineage by BAP treatment offers a useful model for following STB formation in vitro and suggest that this protocol may have utility in studying the basis of certain placental diseases, especially preeclampsia, where placental tissue isolated at term or after pregnancy terminations can only offer limited information."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72712GSE72751	The methylome of Alu repeats in colon cancer	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72751GSE72790	Cancer associated SF3B1 hotspot mutations induce cryptic 3' splice site selection through use of a different branch point	"Recurrent mutations in the spliceosome are observed in several human cancers but their functional and therapeutic significance remain elusive. SF3B1, the most frequently mutated component of the spliceosome in cancer, is involved in the recognition of the branch point sequence (BPS) during selection of the 3 splice site (ss) in RNA splicing. Here, we report that common and tumor-specific splicing aberrations are induced by SF3B1 mutations and establish aberrant 3 ss selection as the most frequent splicing defect. Strikingly, mutant SF3B1 utilizes a BPS that differs from that used by wild-type SF3B1 and requires the canonical 3 ss to enable aberrant splicing during the second step. Approximately 50%% of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated decay resulting in downregulation of gene and protein expression.

Phenotypically, MAB manifests as either a Smooth (MAB-S) or a Rough (MAB-R) morphotype, which differ in their levels of cell wall glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) and in their pathogenicity in vivo. As one of the primary immune cells encountered by MAB, we sought to examine the early transcriptional events within macrophages, following infection with both MAB-S or MAB-R. We sampled the small RNA (sRNA) transcriptome of THP-1-derived macrophages infected with both MAB-R and MAB-S at 1, 4 and 24 hours post-infection (hpi) using RNA-seq. MAB-S elicited a more robust transcriptional response at the miRNA level, reflecting higher cytokine levels in culture supernatants. However, and a direct comparison identified no differentially expressed miRNAs between MAB-R- and MAB-S-infected cells. Most of the induced miRNAs have previously been associated with mycobacterial infection and overall miRNA expression patterns were similarly highly correlated between the morphotypes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72821GSE72915	Chromatin-remodelling complex NURF is essential for differentiation of adult melanocyte stem cells	"MIcrophthalmia-associated Transcription Factor (MITF) regulates melanocyte and melanoma physiology. ShRNA-mediated silencing of the NURF subunit BPTF revealed its essential role in several melanoma cell lines and in untransformed melanocytes in vitro. Comparative RNA-seq shows that MITF and BPTF co-regulate overlapping gene expression programs in cell lines in vitro. Somatic and specific inactivation of Bptf in developing murine melanoblasts in vivo shows that Bptf regulates their proliferation, migration and morphology. Once born, Bptf-mutant mice display premature greying where the second post-natal coat is white. This second coat is normally pigmented by differentiated melanocytes derived from the adult melanocyte stem cell (MSC) population that is stimulated to proliferate and differentiate at anagen. An MSC population is established and maintained throughout the life of the Bptf- mutant mice, but these MSCs are abnormal and at anagen, give rise to reduced numbers of transient amplifying cells (TACs) that do not express melanocyte markers and fail to differentiate into mature melanin producing melanocytes. MSCs display a transcriptionally repressed chromatin state and Bptf is essential for reactivation of the melanocyte gene expression program at anagen, the subsequent normal proliferation of TACs and their differentiation into mature melanocytes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72915GSE72932	Bromodomain-containing Protein 4 (BRD4) is Required for the Maintenance of a Mammary Epithelial Phenotype [RNA-Seq]	"Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is an important epigenetic reader which promotes gene transcription to modulate cell-specific functions and is under intensive investigation for its potential as an anti-tumor therapeutic target. However, the role of BRD4 in non-transformed cells remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that BRD4 is required for the expression of epithelial-specific genes and suppression of stem cell-like properties by binding to the distal regions of epithelial-related genes. Moreover, BRD4 occupancy correlates with enhancer activity and enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription of epithelial differentiation-specific genes. Interestingly, we show that BRD4 perturbation regulates the expression of Grainy Head-like transcription factor, GRHL3, whose depletion partially mimics BRD4 inhibition and blocks differentiated phenotype. By binding to the distal regions of GRHL3, BRD4 promotes RNA polymerase-II occupancy and thus affects eRNA transcription. Altogether, these findings provide evidence that BRD4 promotes a differentiated epithelial phenotype in non-transformed mammary cells at least in part through the activation of GRHL3 expression."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72932GSE72955	Retroviral Replicating Vectors Deliver Cytosine Deaminase Leading to Targeted 5-FU-Mediated Cytotoxicity in Multiple Human Cancer Types	"Toca 511 is a modified Retroviral Replicating Vector based on Moloney gretrovirus with an amphotropic envelope.

"Purpose: To compare the transcriptome profiles (RNA-seq) of cultured human epididymis cells and tissue from the caput, corpus and cauda regions of the human epididymis. Methods: Human epididymis tissue was obtained with Institutional Review Board approval from 3 patients (UC05, UC06, UC09, range: 22 - 36 years) undergoing inguinal radical orchiectomy for a clinical diagnosis of testicular cancer. None of the epididymides had extension of the testicular cancer. The three anatomical regions: caput, corpus and cauda, were separated and segments of each snap frozen. Adult human epididymis epithelial (HEE) cultures were also established from tissue. RNA was extracted from both tissue and cultured HEE cells and RNA-seq libraries prepared (TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2, Low-Throughput protocol, Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 machines. Data were analyzed using TopHat and Cufflinks. Results: Libraries generated ~19-39 million reads per library from the cells (95-99%% mapping to the human genome) and ~14-39 million reads from the tissue samples (84-99%% mapped). Raw reads were aligned to the genome with Tophat and gene expression values were processed using Cufflinks as Fragments Per Kilobase per Million mapped fragments (FPKM). FPKM values were subject to principle component analysis, which revealed that though caput, corpus and cauda cell samples respectively from UC05, UC06 and UC09 clustered together. RNA-seq data from the 3 biological replicas (UC05, UC06 and UC09) of caput, corpus and cauda were pooled for further analysis. Cufflinks was used to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between caput, corpus and cauda cells, combined from the 3 donors. The gene expression profiles of corpus and cauda are remarkably similar and both differ from the caput to a similar degree. We identified ~40 genes differentially expressed between corpus and cauda and more than 1600 DEGs between caput and cauda. The DEGs for each comparison (caput and corpus/cauda) were analysed using a gene ontology process enrichment analysis (DAVID, Huang et al., NAR 2009;37:1-13, Huang et al., 2009 Nat Prot 4:44-57). Conclusions: Here we describe an in depth analysis of the gene expression repertoire of primary cultures of epithelial cells and intact tissues from each region of the adult human epididymis. These data will be valuable to decipher pathways of normal epididymis function and aspects of epididymis disease that cause male infertility."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72986GSE72994	Human stem cell based models of neuronal migration provide insight into neurological disease pathogenesis and potential treatment	"Neuronal migration defects (NMDs) are among the most common and severe brain abnormalities in humans. Lack of disease models in mice or in human cells has hampered the identification of underlying mechanisms. From patients with severe NMDs we generated iPSCs then differentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs). On artificial extracellular matrix, patient-derived neuronal cells showed defective migration and impaired neurite outgrowth. From a cohort of 107 families with NMDs, sequencing identified two homozygous C-terminal truncating mutations in CTNNA2, encoding N-catenin, one of three paralogues of the -catenin family, involved in epithelial integrity and cell polarity. Patient-derived or CRISPR-targeted CTNNA2- mutant neuronal cells showed defective migration and neurite stability. Recombinant N-catenin was sufficient to bundle purified actin and to suppress the actin-branching activity of ARP2/3. Small molecule inhibitors of ARP2/3 rescued the CTNNA2 neurite defect. Thus, disease modeling in human cells could be used to understand NMD pathogenesis and develop treatments for associated disorders."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72994GSE73016	Primary human trophoblast from term placenta	"We compare two groups of transcriptome profiles.

Primary human trophoblasts (PHT) were purified cytotrophoblast populations from whole term placentas and then cultured in vitro. The cytotrophoblasts were cultured for short (9 h) or long (48 h) term that show undifferentiated (PHTu) or differentiated (PHTd) phenotype that led syncytialization, respectively.

Our studies have focused on pinin (PNN), an exon junction component (EJC) that has dramatic implications on corneal epithelial cell differentiation and may act as a stabilizer of the corneal epithelial cell phenotype. Our studies revealed that PNN is involved in both transcriptional repression complexes and the spliceosomal complexes, placing PNN at the fulcrum between chromatin and mRNA splicing. Transcriptome analysis of PNN-knockdown cells revealed clear and reproducible alterations in transcript profiles and splicing patterns of a subset of genes that would significantly impact the epithelial cell phenotype. Here, we further investigate PNNs role in the regulation of gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) in a corneal epithelial context. We used human corneal epithelial cells (HCET cells) that carry doxycycline-inducible PNN-knockdown shRNA vector and performed RNA-seq to determine differential gene expression and differential AS events. Multiple genes and AS events were identified as differentially expressed between PNN-knockdown and controls cells. Genes up-regulated by PNN-knockdown included a large proportion of genes that are associated with processes associated with enhanced cell migration and ECM remodeling including: MMPs, ADAMs, HAS2, LAMA3, CXCRs and UNC5C. Genes down-regulated in response to PNN depletion included: IGFBP5. FGD3, FGFR2, PAX6, RARG and SOX10. AS events in PNN compared to controls was also more likely to be detected, and uregulated in PNN-knockdowns. In particular, 60%% of exon skipping events detected in only one condition were detected in PNN-knockdowns and of the shared exon skipping events, 92%% of those differentially expressed were more frequent in the PNN-knockdown. This suggests that in the absence of PNN the epithelial cells are dramatically transformed in the amount and composition of isoforms and that PNN plays a crucial role in the selection of which isoforms differentiating cells produce. Many of the genes affected by PNN-knockdown are known to affect epithelial phenotype. This window into the complexity of RNA splicing in the corneal epithelium implies that PNN exerts broad influence over the regulation and maintenance of epithelial cell phenotype."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73060GSE73075	Epigenetic Control of Skeletal Development by the Histone Methyltransferase Ezh2	Inhibition of H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 enhances osteogenic commitment of human mesenchymal progenitors and Ezh2 inactivation in mouse calvarial cells induces a post-proliferative state concomitant with increased production of a bone-related mineralizing extra-cellular matrix.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73075GSE73109	"EZH2 and BCL6 cooperate to assemble CBX8-BCOR Polycomb complex to repress bivalent promoters, mediate germinal center formation and promote lymphomagenesis [RNA-seq]"	"EZH2 mediates the humoral immune response and drives lymphomagenesis through de novo formation of bivalent chromatin domains and critical germinal center (GC) B cell promoters.

The cellular fractions within and across the primary (pRCC) and metastatic RCC (mRCC) are heterogeneous in both their genetic and biological features determining the variability in clinical aggressiveness and sensitivity to the therapy. To achieve sustainable therapeutic benefit with targeted agents in mRCC, the effective target should focus on signaling pathways that are related to driver mutations occurred early in the clonal evolution of the disease and thus should be common to primary tumor and metastatic sites. Considering that extensive genetic heterogeneity may result in drug response variability among patients and treatment resistance, the tailored strategies for metastatic RCC is urgently needed.

Here, we devised a strategy to assess the contribution of clonal growth, reprogramming method and genetic background to transcriptional patterns in hESCs and hiPSCs. Surprisingly, transcriptional variation originating from two different genetic backgrounds was dominant over variation due to the reprogramming method or cell type of origin of pluripotent cell lines. Moreover, the few differences we detected between isogenic hESCs and hiPSCs neither predicted functional outcome, nor distinguished an independently derived, larger set of unmatched hESC/hiPSC lines. We conclude that hESCs and hiPSCs are transcriptionally and functionally highly similar and cannot be distinguished by a consistent gene expression signature. Our data further imply that genetic background variation is a major confounding factor for transcriptional comparisons of pluripotent cell lines, explaining some of the previously observed expression differences between unmatched hESCs and hiPSCs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73211GSE73213	Promoter H3K4 methylation reveals the dynamic reinforcement of activation-induced pathways in human CD4 T cells with differential kinetics in nave and memory cells (RNA-Seq)	"The epigenetic determinants driving the rapid responses of memory CD4 T cells to antigen are currently an area of active research. While much has been done to characterize various Th subsets and their associated genome-wide epigenetic patterns, the dynamics of histone modifications during CD4 T cell activation and the differential kinetics of these epigenetic marks between nave and memory T cells have not been evaluated. In this study we have detailed the dynamics of genome-wide promoter H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 over a time course during activation of human nave and memory CD4 T cells. Our results demonstrate that changes to H3K4 methylation predominantly occur relatively late after activation (120 hours) and reinforce activation-induced upregulation of gene expression affecting multiple pathways important to T cell activation, differentiation, and function. The dynamics and mapped pathways of H3K4 methylation are distinctly different in memory cells. Memory CD4 have substantially more promoters marked by H3K4me3 alone, and that is influenced by promoter CpG content, reinforcing their more differentiated state. Our study provides the first data examining genome-wide histone modification dynamics during T cell activation, providing insight into the cross-talk between H3K4 methylation and gene expression, and underscoring the impact of these marks upon key pathways integral to CD4 T cell activation and function."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73213GSE73268	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of HCC cells transfected with NCsiRNA or ODC1siRNA	"We investigated if targeting of ODC1 with siRNA could inhibit HCC progression.

To obtain insights into the molecular changes in response to ODC1 knockdown, global changes in gene expression were examined using RNA sequencing. Our results show that ODC1 silencing caused inhibition of HCC cell growth through blockade of cell cycle progression and a strong induction of apoptosis. Subsequent Western blotting revealed that ODC1 silencing decreased the levels of cell cycle regulator cyclin E1, PARP-1, and pro-caspase 3 accelerating apoptotic signaling in HCC cells. In addition, ODC1 silencing resulted in a strong inhibition in the expressions of important regulators of glycolysis and lipogenesis, GLUT4 and ChREBP, and caused a marked decrease in fat accumulation.

While MRSA was once mainly considered a hospital-acquired infection, the emergence of new strains, some of which are pandemic, has resulted in community-acquired MRSA infections that often present as serious skin infections in otherwise healthy individuals. Accordingly, defining the mechanisms that govern the activation and regulation of the immune response to MRSA is clinically important and could lead to the discovery of much needed rational targets for therapeutic intervention. Because the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoetin (TSLP) is highly expressed by keratinocytes of the skin3, we investigated its role in host-defense against MRSA. Here we demonstrate that TSLP acts on neutrophils to increase their killing of MRSA. In particular, we show that both mouse and human neutrophils express functional TSLP receptors. Strikingly, TSLP enhances mouse neutrophil killing of MRSA in both an in vitro whole blood killing assay and an in vivo skin infection model. Similarly, TSLP acts directly on purified human blood neutrophils to reduce MRSA burden. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that TSLP mediates these effects both in vivo and in vitro by engaging the complement C5 system. Thus, TSLP increases MRSA killing in a neutrophil- and complement-dependent manner, revealing a key connection between TSLP and the innate complement system, with potentially important therapeutic implications for control of MRSA infection."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73313GSE73317	Gene expression analysis of BRD4 knockdown in HT-29 and HCT116 cells	RNAseq is performed (50bp single end reads) on HT-29 and HCT-116 cell lines utilizing two independent shRNAs against BRD4 and a non-targeting control shRNA (NTC)	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73317GSE73318	Gene expression analysis following JQ1 treatments in colon cancer lines	"RNAseq is performed (50bp single end reads) on SW480, HT-29, HCT-15, HCT-116, COLO 205, and COLO 320 cell lines after DMSO or JQ1 treatment"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73318GSE73325	"4sUDRB-seq of human PA1 cells, undifferentiated H9 cells and H9 differentiated FB neurons"	"We have optimized the metabolic tagging of newly transcribed RNAs by 4-thiouridine (4sU) to identify newly-transcribed (nascent) circRNAs from human PA1 cells, undifferentiated H9 cells and H9 differentiated FB neurons."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73325GSE73362	Histone Demethylase-Assisted Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer Facilitates Derivation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells	"The extremely low efficiency of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derivation using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) limits potential application.

We previously showed in mice that reduction of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) through ectopic expression of the H3K9me3 demethylase Kdm4d greatly improves SCNT embryo development. Here we show that overexpression of a related H3K9me3 demethylase KDM4A improves human SCNT, and that, as in mice, H3K9me3 in the human somatic cell genome is an SCNT reprogramming barrier. Overexpression of KDM4A significantly improves the blastocyst formation rate in human SCNT embryos by facilitating transcriptional reprogramming, allowing derivation of NTESCs from all oocyte donors tested using adult AMD patient somatic nuclei donors.

Here, we found that DGCR8 co-purifies with subunits of the nuclear exosome, preferentially associating with its hRRP6-containing nucleolar form. Importantly, we demonstrate that DGCR8 is essential for the recruitment of the exosome to snoRNAs and to human telomerase RNA. In addition, we show that the DGCR8/exosome complex controls the stability of the human telomerase RNA component (hTR/TERC).

In contrast, co-transcriptional mRNA-splicing is maintained. These factors closely resemble the proteotoxic stress response during tumor development. The bromodomain protein BRD4 has been identified as an integral member of the oxidative stress as well as of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, there is evidence for BRD4's role in splicing regulation; Using RNA-Seq analyses we indeed found a significant increase in splicing inhibition, in particular intron retentions, during heat treatment in BRD4-deficient cells, but not under normal conditions. Subsequent experiments revealed that heat stress leads to the recruitment of BRD4 to nuclear stress bodies, to the interaction with the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and to the transcriptional up-regulation of non-coding Sat III RNA transcripts. These findings implicate BRD4 as a central regulator of splicing during heat stress.

Using a new hierarchical linear regression algorithm to score our screen results and integrate them with accompanying detailed genetic and proteomic information, we identify novel vulnerabilities in breast cancer, including new candidate drivers, and reveal general functional genomic properties of cancer cells. Comparisons of gene essentiality with drug sensitivity data suggest potential resistance mechanisms, novel effects of existing anti-cancer drugs, and new opportunities for combination therapy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this large dataset by identifying BRD4 as a potential target in luminal breast cancer, and PIK3CA mutations as a resistance determinant for BET-inhibitors.

Nevertheless, much is still unknown concerning the specific responses of tumors when challenged by lymphocyte infiltration. Based on this void, we conducted a immuno-phenotype comparison using mRNA sequencing between the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 and the luminal breast cancer cell line MCF7 after both were co-cultured with activated human T-cells. We found that, though the cytokine-induced immune signature of the two cell lines was similar, MDA-MD-231 cells were able to transcribe IDO1 at a significantly higher level than MCF7 cells. Though no differences occurred in upstream JAK/STAT1 signaling or IDO1 mRNA stability between the two cell lines, stimulation with IFN was able to differentially induce IDO protein expression and enzymatic activity in ER- cell lines compared to ER+ cell lines. Further experiments show that 5-aza-deoxycytidine treatment was able to reverse suppression of IDO1 expression in MCF7 cells, suggesting DNA methylation as a potential determinant in IDO1 induction. By analyzing TCGA breast cancer datasets, we discovered subtype-specific mRNA and promoter methylation differences in IDO1, with TNBC/basal subtypes exhibiting lower methylation/higher expression and ER+/luminal subtypes exhibiting higher methylation/lower expression. We confirmed this trend of IDO1 methylation by bisulfite pyrosequencing breast cancer cell lines and an independent cohort of primary breast tumors. Taken together, these findings suggest that IDO1 methylation regulates anti-immune responses in breast cancer subtypes and could be used as a predictive biomarker for IDO inhibitor-based immunotherapy."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73527GSE73565	Complementary Post Transcriptional Regulatory Information is Detected by PUNCH-P and Ribosome Profiling	"Two novel approaches were recently suggested for genome-wide identification of protein aspects synthesized at a given time. Ribo-Seq is based on sequencing all the ribosome protected mRNA fragments in a cell, while PUNCH-P is based on mass-spectrometric analysis of only newly synthesized proteins. Here we describe the first Ribo-Seq/PUNCH-P comparison via the analysis of mammalian cells during the cell-cycle for detecting relevant differentially expressed genes between G1 and M phase. Our analyses suggest that the two approaches significantly overlap with each other. However, we demonstrate that there are biologically meaningful proteins/genes that can be detected to be post-transcriptionally regulated during the mammalian cell cycle only by each of the approaches, or their consolidation. Such gene sets are enriched with proteins known to be related to intra-cellular signalling pathways such as central cell cycle processes, central gene expression regulation processes, processes related to chromosome segregation, DNA damage, and replication, that are post-transcriptionally regulated during the mammalian cell cycle. Moreover, we show that combining the approaches better predicts steady state changes in protein abundance. The results reported here support the conjecture that for gaining a full post-transcriptional regulation picture one should integrate the two approaches."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73565GSE73570	Identification and characterization of circular RNAs as a new class of putative biomarkers in human blood	"Covalently closed circular RNA molecules (circRNAs) have recently emerged as a class of RNA isoforms with widespread and tissue specific expression across animals, oftentimes independent of the corresponding linear mRNAs. circRNAs are remarkably stable and sometimes highly expressed molecules. Here, we sequenced RNA in human peripheral whole blood to determine the potential of circRNAs as biomarkers in an easily accessible body fluid. We report the reproducible detection of thousands of circRNAs. Importantly, we observed that hundreds of circRNAs are much higher expressed than corresponding linear mRNAs. Thus, circRNA expression in human blood reveals and quantifies the activity of hundreds of coding genes not accessible by classical mRNA specific assays. Our findings suggest that circRNAs could be used as biomarker molecules in standard clinical blood samples."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73570GSE73573	Expression data for KDM1B knockdown in Glioma-Initiating Cells (GICs)	"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, with glioma initiating cells (GICs) implicated to be critical for tumor progression and resistance to therapy.

It has been thought that cysts develop from biliary progenitor cells due to loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), leading to aberrant proliferation or defects in differentiation. Cyst expansion can be suppressed by somatostatin analogues such as lanreotide. There is no human in vitro model available that truly recapitulates polycystic liver disease. We hypothesize that PLD progenitors can form bipotent liver organoids that carry key features of cyst development. To find gene expression differences between Human Polycystic Liver Disease and Normal Biliary Stem Cells. Methods: Cells from normal biliary duct (n=6), cyst biliary epithelium (n=60) and cyst fluid (n=31) were isolated and placed under conditions suitable for expansion of human adult liver stem cells. We analyzed genetic LOH, gene expression, differentiation capacity, response to lanreotide and cilium formation of these organoids. Results: Cholangiocytes from cyst biliary epithelium (47/60) and cyst fluid (9/31) proved capable of expanding as bipotent liver organoids. Multiple cyst organoids displayed LOH surrounding PRKCSH or SEC63 regions. Organoids formed cilia when proliferation was inhibited. Neither hepatocyte nor biliary differentiation of PLD organoids was impaired. RNAseq revealed no significantly dysregulated pathway in PLD organoids. Lanreotide significantly decreased expansion of liver organoids in comparison to negative control (197%%  46%% versus 547%%  28%%; p: 0.038). Conclusion & discussion: Biliary progenitor cells from patient cyst epithelium and fluid can expand into liver organoids. They recapitulate key characteristics of PLD, and are a promising human in vitro model for research, diagnostics and treatment of polycystic liver diseases and cholangiociliopathies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73579GSE73588	HCT116 cells treated with the p97 inhibitior CB-5083	"The goal of this study was to analyze differential gene expression 8 hr after treatment of CB-5083, a small molecule inhibitor of p97 (VCP), in HCT116 cells grown in culture."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73588GSE73628	"RNA-Seq data for AKT, BAD, ERBB2, IGF1R, RAF1 and ERK1 over-expressed samples with twelve green fluorescent protein control samples using human mammary epithelial cells"	"The goal was to capture the transcriptional activity due to over-expression of AKT, BAD, ERBB2, IGF1R, RAF1 and ERK1 genes.Over-expressions were validated using Western Blots.

Here, we report the development of structurally novel estrogens with favorable target tissue-selective estrogenic activity. Through a process of structural alteration of the hormone estradiol that preserves essential chemical and physical features of estradiol but greatly moderates its binding affinity for the estrogen receptors (ERs), we obtained Pathway Preferential Estrogens (PaPEs) capable of having interaction with ER that is sufficient to activate the extranuclear-initiated signaling pathway preferentially over the direct nuclear-initiated pathway. PaPE modulate a pattern of gene regulation and cellular and biological processes that result in essentially no stimulation of reproductive and mammary tissues and breast cancer cells, but have a favorable pattern of activity on metabolic tissues and the vasculature. The structural permutation process represents a novel approach to govern the balance in utilization of extranuclear vs. nuclear pathways of ER action to obtain tissue-selective/non-nuclear pathway-preferential estrogens, which should prove to be beneficial for postmenopausal hormone replacement. The approach may also have broad applicability for other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73663GSE73678	Canonical poly(A) polymerase activity promotes the decay of a wide variety of mammalian nuclear RNAs	"The human nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 has been implicated in the decay of nuclear noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). In addition, PABPN1 stimulates hyperadenylation by poly(A) polymerase, and this activity is thought to be required for decay. Here, we inactivated hyperadenylation by two distinct mechanisms and examined changes in gene expression in HEK293 cells by RNAseq. We observed the upregulation of various ncRNAs, including snoRNA host genes, primary miRNA transcripts, and upstream antisense RNAs, confirming that hyperadenylation is broadly required for the degradation of PABPN1-targets. In addition, we found that mRNAs with retained introns are susceptible to PABPN1 and PAP/-mediated decay (PPD). Transcripts are targeted for degradation due to inefficient export, which is a consequence of reduced intron number or incomplete splicing.

While targeted inhibitors yield significant responses, their clinical benefit is often limited by the early onset of drug resistance. This motivates the pursuit to establish more durable clinical responses, by developing combinatorial therapies. But while potential new combinatorial targets steadily increase in numbers, they cannot possibly all be tested in patients. Similarly, while genetically engineered mouse melanoma models have great merit, they do not capture the enormous genetic diversity and heterogeneity typical in human melanoma. Furthermore, whereas in vitro studies have many advantages, they lack the presence of micro-environmental factors, which can have a profound impact on tumor progression and therapy response. This prompted us to develop an in vivo model for human melanoma that allows for studying the dynamics of tumor progression and drug response, with concurrent evaluation and optimization of new treatment regimens. Here, we present a collection of patient-derived xenografts (PDX), derived from BRAFV600E, NRASQ61 or BRAFWT/NRASWT melanoma metastases. The BRAFV600E PDX melanomas were acquired both prior to treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and after resistance had occurred, including six matched pairs. We find that PDX resemble their human donors melanomas regarding biomarkers, chromosomal aberrations, RNA expression profiles, mutational spectrum and targeted drug resistance patterns. Mutations, previously identified to cause resistance to BRAF inhibitors, are captured in PDX derived from resistant melanomThis melanoma PDX platform represents a comprehensive public resource to study both fundamental and translational aspects of melanoma progression and treatment in a physiologically relevant setting."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73737GSE73742	EP400 Deposits H3.3 into Promoters and Enhancers During Gene Activation	"Purpose: We wanted to know how histone variants H3.3 and H2AZ are deposited into genes and enhancers during gene activation Methods: U2OS cells were harvested at 70%% confluency with formaldehyde crosslinking for ChIP-seq without crosslinking for RNA-seq.

In the mouse, the related transcriptional regulators Six1 and Six2 play non-overlapping roles in nephron progenitors. Transient Six1 activity prefigures, and is essential for, active nephrogenesis. In contrast, Six2 maintains later progenitor self-renewal from the onset of nephrogenesis. We compared Six2s regulatory actions in mouse and human nephron progenitors by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). Surprisingly, SIX1 was identified as a SIX2 target unique to the human nephron progenitors. Further, RNA-seq and immunostaining revealed overlapping SIX1 and SIX2 progenitor activity in the 16 week human fetal kidney. Human SIX1 ChIP-seq revealed a similar set of targets to SIX2, and predicted both factors bind DNA through an identical recognition site. In contrast to the mouse where Six2 binds its own enhancers but doesnt interact with DNA around Six1, both human SIX1 and SIX2 bind homologous SIX2 enhancers and putative enhancers positioned around SIX1. Transgenic analysis of a putative human SIX1 enhancer in the mouse revealed a transient, mouse-like, pre-nephrogenic, Six1 regulatory pattern. Together, these data demonstrate a divergence in SIX-factor regulation between mouse and human nephron progenitors. In the human, an auto/cross-regulatory loop drives continued SIX1 and SIX2 expression during active nephrogenesis. In contrast, the mouse establishes only an auto-regulatory Six2 loop. It is tempting to speculate that differential SIX-factor regulation may contribute to species differences in the duration of progenitor programs and nephron output."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73866GSE73887	"Identification of MEF2B, EBF1, and IL6R as chromosome bound targets of EBNA1 essential for EBV infected B-lymphocyte survival"	"EBNA1 is the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen required for viral episome maintenance during latency. EBNA1 is a sequence specific DNA binding protein with high affinity binding sites for the viral genome, especially OriP. EBNA1 can also bind sequence specifically to a large number of sites in the host cellular genome, but the function of these binding sites has remained elusive. EBNA1 is also known to provide a host cell survival function, but the molecular mechanisms accounting for this function are not completely understood. Here, we show by integrating ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq with experimental validation that MEF2B, IL6R, and EBF1 are high confidence target genes of EBNA1 that are essential for viability of B-lymphocytes latently infected with EBV. We show that EBNA1 binds to ~1000 sites with many, but not all, universally bound in different cell types, including Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We find that a large subset of EBNA1 binding sites are located proximal to transcription start sites and correlate genome-wide with transcription activity. EBNA1 bound to genes of high significance for B-cell growth and function, including MEF2B, IL6R, EBF1, RNF145, POU2F1, KDM4C, FGR, EGFR, LAIR, CDC7, CD44, and IL17A. EBNA1 depletion from latently infected LCLs results in the loss of cell proliferation, and the loss of gene expression for some EBNA1-bound genes, including MEF2B, EBF1, and IL6R. Depletion of MEF2B, EBF1, or IL6R partially phenocopies EBNA1-depletion by decreasing EBV-positive cell growth and viability. These findings indicate that EBNA1 binds to a large cohort of cellular genes important for cell viability, and implicates EBNA1 as a master coordinator of host cell gene expression important for enhanced survival of latently infected cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73887GSE73893	Cross-talk between PRMT1-mediated methylation and ubiquitylation on RBM15 controls RNA splicing	"RBM15, an RNA binding protein, determines cell-fate specification of many tissues including blood. We demonstrate that RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) at residue R578 leading to its degradation via ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase (CNOT4). Overexpression of PRMT1 in acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines blocks megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by downregulation of RBM15 protein level. Restoring RBM15 protein level rescues megakaryocyte terminal differentiation blocked by PRMT1 overexpression. At the molecular level, RBM15 binds to pre-mRNA intronic regions of genes important for megakaryopoiesis such as GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1 and c-MPL. Furthermore, preferential binding of RBM15 to specific intronic regions recruits the splicing factor SF3B1 to the same sites for alternative splicing. Therefore, PRMT1 regulates alternative RNA splicing via reducing RBM15 protein concentration. Targeting PRMT1 may be a curative therapy to restore megakaryocyte differentiation for acute megakaryocytic leukemia."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73893GSE73929	Genome-wide MAF1-dependent regulation of RNA polymerase III transcription [RNA-Seq]	"In higher eukaryotes, an important mechanism to tune translation in different tissues and conditions is mTORC1-dependent regulation of tRNAs transcription by RNA polymerase III (Pol III), as the relative amount of tRNAs tightly coordinates with the translational needs of the cell. mTORC1 contributes to regulate protein synthesis through its direct substrate MAF1, which functions as a negative regulator of Pol III transcription in response to stimuli such as serum starvation or rapamycin treatment. Here, we applied ChIP-seq to examine the Pol III occupancy profile in human fibroblasts and report evidence of a genome wide, MAF1-dependent coordinated response to favorable or stress growth conditions. Strikingly, while a set of genes is extremely responsive in terms of Pol III binding, other genes are mostly unperturbed, yet associated with transcriptionally engaged polymerases as revealed by nascent EU-labeled RNA-seq (neuRNA-seq).

Here, we show that m1A is prevalent in Homo sapiens mRNA, which shows an m1A/A ratio of ~0.02%%. We develop the m1A-ID-seq technique, based on m1A immunoprecipitation and the inherent ability of m1A to stall reverse tran- scription, as a means for transcriptome-wide m1A profiling. m1A-ID-seq identifies 901 m1A peaks (from 600 genes) in mRNA and noncoding RNA and reveals a prominent feature, enrichment in the 5' untranslated region of mRNA transcripts, that is dis- tinct from the pattern for N6-methyladenosine, the most abundant internal mammalian mRNA modification. Moreover, m1A in mRNA is reversible by ALKBH3, a known DNA/RNA demethylase. Lastly, we show that m1A methylation responds dynamically to stimuli, and we identify hundreds of stress-induced m1A sites. Collectively, our approaches allow comprehensive analysis of m1A modification and provide tools for functional studies of potential epigenetic regulation via the reversible and dynamic m1A methylation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73941GSE73942	Limiting cholesterol biosynthetic flux engages type I IFN signaling in a STING-dependent manner	"Cellular lipid requirements are achieved through a combination of biosynthesis and import programs.

Genetically enforcing this metabolic shift in macrophages is sufficient to render mice resistant to viral challenge, demonstrating the importance of reprogramming the balance of these two metabolic pathways in vivo. Unexpectedly, mechanistic studies reveal that limiting flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway spontaneously engages a type I IFN response in a STING-dependent manner. The upregulation of type I IFNs was traced to a decrease in the pool size of synthesized cholesterol, and could be inhibited by replenishing cells with free cholesterol.

This remarkable task is achieved through the delivery of effector proteins from the parasite into the parasitophorous vacuole and host cell cytosol that rewire host cellular pathways, facilitating parasite evasion of the immune system. Here, we have identified a novel export pathway in Toxoplasma that involves cleavage of effector proteins by the Golgi-resident aspartyl protease 5 (ASP5) prior to translocation into the host cell. We demonstrate that ASP5 cleaves a highly constrained amino acid motif that has some similarity to the PEXEL motif of Plasmodium parasites. We show that ASP5 can mature effectors at both the N- and C-terminal ends of proteins and is also required for the trafficking of proteins without this motif. Furthermore, we show that ASP5 controls establishment of the nanotubular network and is required for the efficient recruitment of host mitochondria to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Global assessment of host gene expression following infection reveals that ASP5-dependent pathways influence thousands of the transcriptional changes that Toxoplasma imparts on its host cell.

Differential gene expression and pathway analysis pointed to TGF-b and netrin-1 as the top dysregulated pathways. Using data driven gene coexpression network analysis, we identified seven distinct coexpression modules, and focused on two that were correlated with changes in gene expression in NSC due to the CAG expansion.

Senescent cells display a repressive chromatin configuration thought to stably silence proliferation-promoting genes, while at the same time activate an unusual form of immune surveillance involving a secretory program referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here we demonstrate that senescence also involves a global remodeling of the enhancer landscape with recruitment of the chromatin reader BRD4 to newly activated super-enhancers adjacent to key SASP genes. Transcriptional profiling and functional studies indicate that BRD4 is required for the SASP and downstream paracrine signaling. Consequently, BRD4 inhibition disrupts immune cell-mediated targeting and elimination of premalignant senescent cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results identify a critical role for BRD4-bound super-enhancers in senescence immune surveillance and in the proper execution of a tumor-suppressive program."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74324GSE74339	Assessment of ability of hTSLP to maintain primary CRLF2 B-ALL cells in a xenograft model in a state more similar to the parent leukemia	"Xenograft models represent an excellent method for expanding primary leukemias, but their ability to preserve the gene expression profile of the parent leukemia may also depend on providing microenvironmental factors that are not cross-reactive between human and mouse.

Circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) are clusters of CTCs that have been described as malignant entities for over 50 years, although a comprehensive characterization of these cells is still lacking. Contrary to current consensus, we demonstrate that CTM isolated from colorectal cancer patients are not cancerous, but represent a discrete population of tumor-derived endothelial cells. CTM express epithelial and mesenchymal markers that are consistent with previous reports on circulating tumor cell phenotyping. However, they do not mirror the genetic variations of matching tumors. Transcriptome analysis of single-CTM reveals that these structures exhibit an endothelial phenotype, with further results supporting a tumor-derived endothelial lineage. CTM are widespread in blood sampled from preoperative cancer patients but not in healthy donors, suggesting CTM count as a potential biomarker of interest for colorectal cancer. CTM should not be confused with bona fide circulating epithelial tumor cells. The characterization of tumor derived endothelial cell clusters (TECCs) is likely of high diagnostic value, and may provide direct information about the underlying tumor vasculature at the time of diagnosis, during treatment and the course of the disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74369GSE74377	Overexpression of PHF8 promotes an EMT-related gene signature in MCF10A cells	"PHF8 exerts distinct functions in different types of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying its specific functions in each case remain obscure. To establish whether overexpression of PHF8 regulates the TGF- induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we treated MCF10A-Mock (control) and MCF10A-PHF8wt (overexpressing wild-type PHF8) cells with TGF-1 for 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours and performed RNA-seq in biological duplicates. Our data indicated that EMT gene signatures were significantly enriched in MCF10A-PHF8 cells with TGF-1 treatment at all time points, strongly indicating that PHF8 overexpression induces a sustained EMT signaling program."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74377GSE74439	The pentose phosphate pathway regulates the circadian clock	"The circadian clock is a ubiquitous timekeeping system that organizes the behavior and physiology of organisms over the day and night. The clockwork orchestrates a multitude of metabolic processes as illustrated by previous global transcriptomics and proteomics studies, and the existence of daily rhythms of reduction and oxidation (redox) in a range of diverse species. However, the reciprocal question of whether metabolism can alter the clockwork remains largely unaddressed. Here we identify the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a critical source of cellular reducing power in the form of NADPH, as an important modulator of circadian oscillations. We show that genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of the PPP perturbs circadian gene expression and metabolic rhythms in human cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of the PPP caused similar effects in mouse tissues, and altered the pattern of rhythmic behavior in Drosophila. These manipulations also altered genome wide DNA-binding activity of the circadian transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK through a mechanism likely involving the redox-sensitive histone acetyltransferase p300. Thus, disruption of the PPP regulates circadian rhythms via modulation of NADPH metabolism, highlighting redox reactions as a novel connector of metabolic cycles and transcriptional oscillations in nucleated cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74439GSE74442	Diverse and Targetable Kinase Alterations Drive Histiocytic Neoplasms	"Histiocytic neoplasms are clonal, hematopoietic disorders characterized by an accumulation of abnormal, monocyte-derived dendritic cells or macrophages in Langerhans Cell (LCH) and non-Langerhans (non-LCH) histiocytoses, respectively.

However, recurrent driving mutations in the majority of BRAFV600E-wildtype, non-LCH patients are unknown, and recurrent cooperating mutations in non-MAP kinase pathways are undefined for the histiocytic neoplasms. Through combined whole exome and transcriptome sequencing, we identified recurrent kinase fusions involving BRAF, ALK, and NTRK1, as well as recurrent, activating MAP2K1 and ARAF mutations in BRAFV600E-wildtype, non-LCH patients. In addition to MAP kinase pathway lesions, recurrently altered genes involving diverse cellular pathways were identified.

We now report that silencing of the Hippo pathway tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2 in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells reduces p53 phosphorylation and increases its association with the p52 NF-?B subunit. Moreover, it partly shifts p53s conformation and transcriptional output towards a state resembling cancer-associated p53 mutants, and endow p53 with the ability to promote cell migration. Notably, LATS1 and LATS2 are frequently downregulated in breast cancer; we propose that such downregulation might benefit cancer by converting p53 from a tumor suppressor into a tumor facilitator."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74493GSE74550	A designed inhibitor of p53 aggregation rescues p53 tumor-suppression in ovarian carcinomas	"Half of all human cancers lose p53 function by missense mutations, with an unknown fraction of these containing p53 in a self-aggregated, amyloid-like state. Here we show that a cell-penetrating peptide, ReACp53, designed to inhibit p53 amyloid formation, rescues p53 function in cancer cell lines and in organoids derived from high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC), an aggressive cancer characterized by ubiquitous p53 mutations. Rescued p53 behaves similarly to its wild-type counterpart in regulating target genes, reducing cell proliferation and increasing cell death. Intraperitoneal administration decreases tumor proliferation and shrinks xenografts in vivo.

Early studies demonstrate that only stem-like basal cells in the normal human prostate (NHP) can function as the cell of origin for prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we show that the organoids derived from bulkNHPluminal cells can also be tumorigenically transformed. We further show that the WIT medium, which is used to culture human mammary epithelial progenitor cells, when combined with the ROCK inhibitor, can readily propagate a population of progenitor-like cells from the primary NHP luminal cell isolates. Such functionally defined luminal progenitors can be transformed by distinct sets of genetic perturbations (i.e., AR+AKT/ERG or c-MYC+PTEN knockout) to form tumor glands. Genome-wide RNA-Seq analysis of freshly purified unperturbed human benign prostatic basal and luminal cells and culture-expanded lineage specific stem/progenitor populations reveals that the luminal progenitors possess a distinct gene expression profile that is greatly enriched in advanced, castration-resistant, and metastatic PCa, and it associates with poor patient survival. The ability of the simple two-dimensional culture system reported herein to greatly enrichNHPprogenitor-like cells should facilitate biological and biochemical studies as well as high-throughput screening in these cells and in progenitor-like PCa cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74698GSE74716	SMARCA4 regulates gene expression and higher-order chromatin structure in proliferating mammary epithelial cells	"The packaging of DNA into chromatin plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and nuclear processes. Brahma related gene-1 SMARCA4 (also known as BRG1), the essential ATPase subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt nucleosomes at target regions. Although the transcriptional role of SMARCA4 at gene promoters is well-studied, less is known about its role in higher-order genome organization. SMARCA4 knockdown in human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells resulted in 176 up-regulated genes, including many related to lipid and calcium metabolism, and 1292 down-regulated genes, some of which encode extracellular matrix (ECM) components that can exert mechanical forces and affect nuclear structure. ChIP-seq analysis of SMARCA4 localization and SMARCA4-bound super-enhancers demonstrated extensive binding at intergenic regions. Furthermore, Hi-C analysis showed extensive SMARCA4-mediated alterations in higher-order genome organization at multiple resolutions. First, SMARCA4 knockdown resulted in clustering of intra- and inter- sub-telomeric regions, demonstrating a novel role for SMARCA4 in telomere organization. SMARCA4 binding was enriched at TAD (Topologically Associating Domain) boundaries, and SMARCA4 knockdown resulted in weakening of TAD boundary strength. Taken together, these findings provide a dynamic view of SMARCA4-dependent changes in higher-order chromatin organization and gene expression, identifying SMARCA4 as a novel component of chromatin organization."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74716GSE74718	Noncoding somatic and inherited single-nucleotide variants converge to promote ESR1 expression in breast cancer	"Sustained expression of the estrogen receptor- (ESR1) drives two-thirds of breast cancer and defines the ESR1-positive subtype. ESR1 engages enhancers upon estrogen stimulation to establish an oncogenic expression program1. Somatic copy number alterations involving the ESR1 gene occur in approximately 1 %% of ESR1-positive breast cancers25, suggesting that other mechanisms underlie the persistent expression of ESR1. We report significant enrichment of somatic mutations within the set of regulatory elements (SRE) regulating ESR1 in 7%% of ESR1-positive breast cancers. These mutations regulate ESR1 expression by modulating transcription factor binding to the DNA. The SRE includes a recurrently mutated enhancer whose activity is also affected by rs9383590, a functional inherited single-nucleotide variant (SNV) that accounts for several breast cancer riskassociated loci.

We previously applied nanotechnology tools of photolithography to generate custom microarrays that allow high throughput uniform formation of EBs of custom size for precise downstream analysis. Formation of EBs of 200 or 500 micron size revealed distinct morphological differences that are single or multicystic cores, respectively, independent of method of formation from single cells or two-dimensional (2D) clusters. Here we utilize photolithographic array generated EBs to obtain 3D cultures under a standardized platform for transcriptome analysis to compare EB size and the method of EB formation from single cells or mechanically passaged 2D clusters. Our analysis evaluates RNA expression in EBs formed from the human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line WA09 and from ethnically diverse human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (ED-iPSC) of African American and Hispanic Latino ethnicity recently derived in our laboratory. This is the first comprehensive study on EB transcriptomes including multiple size parameters, EB formation methodologies, and ethnicities. Our analysis indicates upregulation of genes involved in wound healing for mechanically passaged cells and of genes for embryonic tube formation in 500 micron multicystic EBs. We propose that EB maturation may be a longer process then previously realized. In addition, the type or extent of maturation possible may be influenced by EB size, with larger EBs capable of more extensive remodeling as revealed by multicystic morphology and initiation of early tube formation pathways while retaining pluripotency status. We anticipate that this information will be broadly useful to the stem cell and bioengineering communities in optimization of tissue engineering with pluripotent stem cells and understanding sources of variation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74792GSE74798	Tumor-Specific Retrogene NANOGP8 Reprograms Prostate Cancer Cells to Castration Resistance by Engaging the FOXA1/AR Signaling Axis and MYC [RNA-seq]	"Targeted disruption of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and pluripotency factor NANOG diminishes cancer cell clonogenic growth in vitro and tumor development in vivo.

Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying NANOG-mediated oncogenesis and prostate cancer progression to androgen independence. ChIP-Seq analysis of LNCaP prostate cancer cells overexpressing doxycycline-inducible NANOG (either NANOG1 or NANOGP8 vs pLVX control) reveal that NANOG coordinately occupies regions of chromatin regulated by AR signaling steroid-receptor complex proteins AR, FOXA1 and NKX3.1.

[RNA-Seq]"	"Purpose: There is substantial heterogeneity within the human papillomavirus (HPV) positive head and neck cancer (HNC) tumors that predispose them to different outcomes, however this subgroup is poorly characterized due to various historical reasons. Experimental Design: we perform unsupervised gene expression clustering on well-annotated HPV(+) HNC samples from two cohorts ( 84 total primary tumors), as well as 18 HPV(-) HNCs, to discover subtypes, and begin to characterize the differences between the subtypes in terms of their HPV characteristics, pathway activity, whole-genome somatic copy number variations and mutation frequencies. Results: We identified two distinctive HPV(+) subtypes by unsupervised clustering. Membership in the HPV(+) subtypes correlates with genic viral integration status, E2/E4/E5 expression levels and the ratio of spliced to full length HPV oncogene E6. The subtypes also show differences in copy number alterations, in particular the loss of chr16q and gain of chr3q, PIK3CA mutation, and in the expression of genes involved in several biological processes related to cancer, including immune response, oxidation-reduction process, and keratinocyte and mesenchymal differentiation. Conclusion: Our characterization of two subtypes of HPV(+) tumors provides valuable molecular level information in relation to the alternative paths to tumor development and to that of HPV(-) HNCs. Together, these results will shed light on stratifications of the HPV(+) HNCs and will help to guide personalized care for HPV(+) HNC patients."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74927GSE74928	"XX-650-23, an inhibitor of CREB-CBP interaction, effect on acute myeloid leukemia cell line"	Analysis of acute myeloid leukemia KG1 cells treated with XX-650-23 (5 mM) for 12hrs.

Induction of fetal-type hemoglobin (HbF) is a promising means to treat these disorders; however, precisely how HbF expression is silenced in adult erythroid cells is not fully understood. Here, we show that the LRF/ZBTB7A transcription factor is a potent repressor of HbF production. LRF inactivation derepresses embryonic/fetal _-globin expression in mouse and human adult erythroid cells. We employed genome-wide analysis of the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and LRF occupancy sites, and demonstrate that LRF occupies the _-globin loci and maintains nucleosome density necessary for _-globin silencing. LRF confers its repressive activity through a unique NuRD repressor complex independent of BCL11A. Strikingly, human erythroid lines lacking both LRF and BCL11A exhibited almost a complete switch in expression from adult- to fetal-type globin, suggesting that these two factors cumulatively represent the near entirety of _-globin repressive activity in adult erythroid cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74977GSE74978	Transcriptome-wide regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and expression by the RNA-binding protein Quaking during monocyte to macrophage differentiation [RNA-Seq]	"Expression levels of the RNA-binding protein Quaking (QKI) are low in monocytes of early, human atherosclerotic lesions, but abundant in macrophages of advanced plaques.

We identified several thousand specific regulatory elements (~10%% of total DHS sites) that become significantly more or less accessible with sodium butyrate or suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) 72-hour treatments. Most of the differential DNase-hypersensitive (DHS) sites display hallmarks of enhancers; including being enriched for non-promoter regions, associated with nearby gene expression changes, and capable of increasing luciferase reporter expression in K562 cells. Differential DHS sites were enriched for key hematopoietic lineage transcription factor motifs, including SPI1 (PU.1), a known pioneer factor. We found PU.1 becomes up-regulated and increases binding at opened DHS sites by ChIP-seq with HDACi treatment, but show that increased PU.1 protein levels alone are sufficient for only modest increases in chromatin accessibility. PU.1 knockdown by shRNA failed to block the HDACi-induced chromatin accessibility and expression changes in K562, suggesting factors other than PU.1 are responsible for establishment of active enhancers in the HDACi induced differentiation process."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74999GSE75011	Transcriptional profiling of TH2 cells identifies pathogenic features associated with asthma	"Allergic asthma and rhinitis are two common chronic allergic diseases that affect the lungs and nose, respectively. Both diseases share clinical and pathological features characteristic of excessive allergen-induced type 2 inflammation, orchestrated by memory CD4+ T cells that produce type 2 cytokines (TH2 cells). However, a large majority of subjects with allergic rhinitis do not develop asthma, suggesting divergence in disease mechanisms. Since TH2 cells play a pathogenic role in both these diseases and are also present in healthy non-allergic subjects, we performed global transcriptional profiling to determine whether there are qualitative differences in TH2 cells from subjects with allergic asthma, rhinitis and healthy controls. TH2 cells from asthmatic subjects expressed higher levels of several genes that promote their survival as well as alter their metabolic pathways to favor persistence at sites of allergic inflammation. In addition, genes that enhanced TH2 polarization and TH2 cytokine production were also upregulated in asthma. Several genes that oppose T cell activation were downregulated in asthma, suggesting enhanced activation potential of TH2 cells from asthmatic subjects. Many novel genes with poorly defined functions were also differentially expressed in asthma. Thus, our transcriptomic analysis of circulating TH2 cells has identified several molecules that are likely to confer pathogenic features to TH2 cells that are either unique or common to both asthma and rhinitis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75011GSE75042	A novel tumor-associated myeloid cell population inhibits antigen-specific immune responses in cancer patients	"Tumor progression is associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment that consists of several elements, such as regulatory T cells, type 2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

We demonstrated that the presence of these cells in dendritic cell (DC)-based anti-tumor vaccines significantly suppresses CD4+ T cells in an antigen-specific manner. In an attempt to reveal the mechanism of this suppressive activity, we noticed that BDCA1+CD14+ cells express elevated levels of the check-point molecule PD-L1, which thereby hinders T cell proliferation. Importantly, although this suppressive BDCA1+CD14+ population expresses markers of both BDCA1+ DCs and monocytes, functional, transcriptome and proteome analyses clearly revealed that they comprise a unique population of cells that is exploited by tumors to evade immunity.

[RNA-Seq]	"Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) is a multisystemic disorder caused by biallelic mutations in SWI/SNF-related matrix associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A-like protein 1 (SMARCAL1). Changes in gene expression appear to underlie the immunodeficiency and arteriosclerosis of SIOD; therefore, we hypothesized that SMARCAL1 deficiency alters renal gene expression to cause the focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) of SIOD. We tested this hypothesis by transcriptome analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) of an SIOD patient kidney, a genetic screen and immunofluorescence. These showed increased expression of genes in the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways in an SIOD patient kidney, interaction of Marcal1 with genes encoding components of the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, and increased levels of unphosphorylated b-catenin and Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) in the glomeruli of SIOD patient kidneys.

"RUNX1 is a transcription factor functioning both as an oncogene and a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. RUNX1 alters chromatin structure in cooperation with chromatin modifier and remodeling enzymes. In this study, we examined the relationship between RUNX1-mediated transcription and genome organization. We characterized genome-wide RUNX1 localization and performed RNA-seq and Hi-C in RUNX1-depleted and control MCF-7 breast cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis showed that RUNX1 depletion led to up-regulation of genes associated with chromatin structure and down-regulation of genes related to extracellular matrix biology, as well as NEAT1 and MALAT1 lncRNAs. Our ChIP-Seq analysis supports a prominent role for RUNX1 in transcriptional activation. About 30%% of all RUNX1 binding sites were intergenic, indicating diverse roles in promoter and enhancer regulation and suggesting additional functions for RUNX1. Hi-C analysis of RUNX1-depleted cells demonstrated that overall three-dimensional genome organization is largely intact, but indicated enhanced association of RUNX1 near Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) boundaries and alterations in long-range interactions. These results suggest an architectural role for RUNX1 in fine-tuning local interactions rather than in global organization. Our results provide novel insight into RUNX1-mediated perturbations of higher-order genome organization that are functionally linked with RUNX1-dependent compromised gene expression in breast cancer cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75070GSE75130	Characterization of macrophage - cancer cell crosstalk in estrogen receptor positive and triple-negative breast cancer	We performed whole transcriptome sequencing of human monocytes that were co-cultured with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) or triple-negative (TNBC) breast cancer cell lines and studied the biological responses related to the differential gene activation in both cell types to understand how different cancer cells educate host cells to support tumor growth	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75130GSE75140	Human cerebral organoids recapitulate gene expression programs of fetal neocortex development.	"Cerebral organoids  three-dimensional cultures of human cerebral tissue derived from pluripotent stem cells  have emerged as models of human cortical development. However, the extent to which in vitro organoid systems recapitulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation programs observed in vivo remains unclear. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect and compare cell composition and progenitor-to-neuron lineage relationships in human cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex. Covariation network analysis using the fetal neocortex data reveals known and novel interactions among genes central to neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In the organoid, we detect diverse progenitors and differentiated cell types of neuronal and mesenchymal lineages, and identify cells that derived from regions resembling the fetal neocortex. We find that these organoid cortical cells use gene expression programs remarkably similar to those of the fetal tissue in order to organize into cerebral cortex-like regions. Our comparison of in vivo and in vitro cortical single cell transcriptomes illuminates the genetic features underlying human cortical development that can be studied in organoid cultures."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75140GSE75146	Nudt3 is a mRNA Decapping Enzyme That Modulates Cell Migration	"The Dcp2 and Nudt16 Nudix hydrolases, are mRNA decapping enzymes that preferentially modulate stability of a subset of mRNAs. Here we report Nudt3 is a third Nudix protein that possess mRNA decapping activity in cells and is a modulator of cell migration in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Genome-wide analysis of Nudt3 compromised cells identified increases in mRNAs involved in cell motility including integrin 6, lipocalin-2 and fibronectin. The increase in mRNA levels was dependent on Nudt3 decapping activity where integrin 6 and lipocalin-2 were modulated directly through mRNA stability, while fibronectin was indirectly controlled. Moreover, increased cell migration observed in Nudt3 depleted cells was mediated through the extracellular integrin 6 and fibronectin protein nexus. We conclude, Nudt3 is an mRNA decapping enzyme that orchestrates expression of a subset of mRNAs to modulate cell migration and further substantiates the existence of multiple decapping enzymes functioning in distinct cellular pathways in mammals."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75146GSE75147	RNA splicing alteration on glioblastoma and normal neural stem cells	"We identified PHF5A as a functional synthetic-lethal hit in glioblastoma stem cells compared to normal neural stem cells.

To extend the catalog of human core and context- dependent fitness genes, we have developed a high-complexity second-generation genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA library and applied it to fitness screens in five human cell lines. Using an improved Bayesian analytical approach, we consistently discover 5-fold more fitness genes than were previously observed. We present a list of 1,580 human core fitness genes and describe their general properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that context-dependent fitness genes accurately recapitulate pathway-specific genetic vulnerabilities induced by known oncogenes and reveal cell-type-specific dependencies for specific receptor tyrosine kinases, even in oncogenic KRAS backgrounds. Thus, rigorous identification of human cell line fitness genes using a high-complexity CRISPR-Cas9 library affords a high-resolution view of the genetic vulnerabilities of a cell.

However, the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. Here we report that EZH1 physically interacts with UXT, one small chaperon-like transcription co-activator of NF-B. UXT specifically interacts with EZH1 and SUZ12, but not EED or EZH2. Similar to UXT, RNA interference of EZH1 and SUZ12 in the cell impairs the transcriptional activation of NF-B target genes after TNF treatment, and increases the induced cell death. Then RNA-Sequencing analysis was used to analysis the transcriptome in HCT116 cells after EZH1 or UXT knockdown. EZH1 or UXT deficiency nearly impaired the induced expression of all the genes by TNF. ChIP-Sequencing was used to analysis the H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 levels in HCT116 cells after EZH1 or UXT knockdown. However, the results show that H3K27 mono-, di- and trimethylation on NF-B target genes are not affected with EZH1 or UXT deficiency. EZH1 does not affect the translocation of RELA/p65 from cytosol to nuclear either. Instead, EZH1 regulates the recruitment of RELA/p65 and RNA POLII to target genes. Taken together, our study demonstrates EZH1 as a positive regulator for NF-B signaling and reveals the underlying mechanism how EZH1 and UXT work together in transcription regulation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75217GSE75220	4sU metabolic labeled transcripts in 65 YRI LCLs	"Noncoding variants play a central role in the genetics of complex traits, but we still lack a full description of the main molecular pathways through which they act. Here we used molecular data to quantify the contribution of cis-acting genetic effects at each major stage of gene regulation from chromatin to proteins, within a population sample of Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We performed 4sU metabolic labeled transcripts in 65 YRI LCLs to identify genetic variants that affect transcription rates. As expected, we found an important contribution of genetic variation via chromatin, contributing 65%% of eQTLs (expression Quantitative Trait Loci). The remaining eQTLs, which are not asso- ciated with chromatin-level variation, are highly enriched in transcribed regions, and hence may affect expression through co- or post-transcriptional processes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75220GSE75234	Impact of H3.3K36M mutation on chondroblastoma cancer epigenome	"Over 90%% of chondroblastomas contain a heterozygous mutation replacing lysine 36 with methionine (K36M) in the histone H3 variant H3.3. The role of the H3.3K36M mutation in tumorigenesis of this typically benign bone tumor with high recurrence rates is unknown. Here, we show that H3K36 di- and tri-methylation (me2 and me3) levels are reduced globally in chondroblastomas, as well as in chondrocytes stably expressing the H3.3K36M mutation because the H3.3M36 mutation protein inhibits the activity of lysine methyl transferases, MMSET and SetD2. Remarkably, at gene bodies, H3K36me2 increases and H3K36me3 decreases, which correlates with elevated and reduced expression of the underlying genes, respectively. Genes with altered H3K36me2/me3 and gene expression are associated with cancer pathways and chondrocyte differentiation. Chondrocytes harboring the H3.3K36M mutation exhibit cancer-associated cellular phenotypes and delayed chondrocyte differentiation associated with reduced Bmp2 and Runx2 expression. Exogenous Bmp2 partially rescued the delays in chondrocyte differentiation. Thus, H3.3K36M mutant proteins dominantly reprogram H3K36me2/me3 and chondrocyte gene expression, inhibiting terminal chondrocyte differentiation and contributing to tumorigenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75234GSE75270	The SPOP-containing Complex Functions as an E3 Ligase for SETD2 to Regulate Gene-Specific H3K36me3-Coupled Alternative Splicing	"H3K36me3 has been reported to associate with active gene expression, and SETD2 is the mainly methyltransferase for H3K36me3. We identified SPOP which is a CUL3 family protein as a E3 ligase for SETD2.

We examined the functional and transcriptional consequences of loss of these methyltransferases in patients with PDAC. Patients with low KMT2C and KMT2D expression demonstrated a much-improved outcome compared with those expressing high levels. RNA-seq analysis of KMT2C or KMT2D loss in three cell lines (PANC1, SUIT2 and COLO357) identified 31 and 124 differentially expressed genes respectively, with 19 genes common to both methlytransferases. Gene set enrichment analysis, and correlation with publicly available patient gene expression (GEP) datasets, highlighted significant reductions in pathways relating to cell-cycle and cell growth, where gene expression correlated with KMT2C/D depletion. Furthermore, loss of Kmt2d in three murine cell lines increased sensitivity to the nucleoside analogue 5-fluorouracil (5FU). These experiments support critical, non-redundant, roles for KMT2D and KMT2C in PDAC, where depletion impacts cell-cycle to reduce cell proliferation, enhance response to specific chemotherapy, which may improve patient survival."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75327GSE75354	A zebrafish melanoma model reveals emergence of neural crest identity during melanoma initiation [human cell line RNA-seq]	We report gene expression data for human melanoma cell lines using RNAseq.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75354GSE75364	Reprogramming by de-bookmarking somatic transcriptional program via targeting the BET bromodomains	"One critical task in pluripotent reprogramming is to erase the somatic transcriptional program of starting cells. No strategy or theory exists for achieving erasure of somatic gene expression memory. Here, we present a proof-of-principle strategy in which reprogramming to pluripotency is facilitated by small molecules that erase somatic cell transcription memory. We show that mild chemical targeting of the acetyllysine-binding pockets of the BET bromodomains, the transcriptional bookmarking domains, robustly enhances reprogramming. Furthermore, we show that chemical targeting of the transcriptional bookmarking BET bromodomains dramatically downregulates specific somatic gene expression programs in both nave and reprogramming fibroblasts. Chemical blocking of the BET bromodomains also resulted in loss of fibroblast morphology early in reprograming. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate a concept for cell fate conversion: facilitating the conversion by chemically targeting the transcriptional bookmarking BET bromodomains responsible for transcriptional memory."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75364GSE75367	HER2 expression identifies dynamic functional states within circulating breast cancer cells	"Circulating tumour cells in women with advanced oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer acquire a HER2-positive subpopulation after multiple courses of therapy. In contrast to HER2-amplified primary breast cancer, which is highly sensitive to HER2-targeted therapy, the clinical significance of acquired HER2 heterogeneity during the evolution of metastatic breast cancer is unknown. Here we analyse circulating tumour cells from 19 women with ER+/HER2- primary tumours, 84%% of whom had acquired circulating tumour cells expressing HER2. Cultured circulating tumour cells maintain discrete HER2+ and HER2- subpopulations: HER2+ circulating tumour cells are more proliferative but not addicted to HER2, consistent with activation of multiple signalling pathways; HER2- circulating tumour cells show activation of Notch and DNA damage pathways, exhibiting resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy, but sensitivity to Notch inhibition. HER2+ and HER2- circulating tumour cells interconvert spontaneously, with cells of one phenotype producing daughters of the opposite within four cell doublings. Although HER2+ and HER2- circulating tumour cells have comparable tumour initiating potential, differential proliferation favours the HER2+ state, while oxidative stress or cytotoxic chemotherapy enhances transition to the HER2- phenotype. Simultaneous treatment with paclitaxel and Notch inhibitors achieves sustained suppression of tumorigenesis in orthotopic circulating tumour cell-derived tumour models. Together, these results point to distinct yet interconverting phenotypes within patient-derived circulating tumour cells, contributing to progression of breast cancer and acquisition of drug resistance."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75367GSE75410	Mitochondrial unfolded protein response controls matrix pre-RNA processing and translation	"The mitochondrial matrix is unique in that it must integrate folding and assembly of proteins derived from nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. In C. elegans, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) senses matrix protein misfolding and induces a program of nuclear gene expression, including mitochondrial chaperonins, to promote mitochondrial proteostasis. While misfolded mitochondrial matrix-localized ornithine trans-carbamylase (OTC) induces chaperonin expression, our understanding of mammalian UPRmt is rudimentary, reflecting a lack of acute triggers for UPRmt activation. This limitation has prevented analysis of the cellular responses to matrix protein misfolding and the effects of UPRmt on mitochondrial translation to control protein folding loads. Here, we combine pharmacological inhibitors of matrix-localized HSP90/TRAP1 or LON protease, which promote chaperonin expression, with global transcriptional and proteomic analysis to reveal an extensive and acute response of human cells to UPRmt. This response involved widespread induction of nuclear genes, including matrix-localized proteins involved in folding, pre-RNA processing and translation. Functional studies revealed rapid but reversible translation inhibition in mitochondria occurring concurrently with defects in pre-RNA processing due to transcriptional repression and LON-dependent turnover of the mitochondrial pre-RNA processing nuclease MRPP3. This study reveals that acute mitochondrial protein folding stress activates both increased chaperone availability within the matrix and reduced matrix-localized protein synthesis through translational inhibition, and provides a framework for further dissection of mammalian UPRmt."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75410GSE75440	Gene expression profiles in NORAD knockout and PUMILIO overexpressing cells	"Purpose: PUMILIO proteins are known to repress target genes by specifically binding to PUMILIO response elements (PREs) in target mRNAs.

Methods: RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Human/Mouse/Rat Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the 100 bp paired-end protocol on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. For comparing NORAD+/+ and NORAD-/- HCT116 cells, 3 biological replicates per genotype were sequenced. For PUM overexpression experiments, 3 replicates of GFP-expressing HCT116 cells (negative control) and 2 independent PUM1- or PUM2-overexpressing clones (2 replicates each) were sequenced. Results: Gene expression profiles show that PUMILIO target genes are downregulated in both NORAD knockout cells and PUMILIO overexpressing cells.

RNA integrity was verified by an RNA 6000 Nano Chip, using BioAnalyzer and 2100 Expert software (Agilent Technologies). The mRNA was enriched by oligo-dT pulldown from total RNA, followed by fragmentation, adapter ligation, PCR amplification, and finally sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. For sequencing introns, the oligo-dT pulldown step was replaced with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal (Illumina). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome hg19 using TopHat 2 set to map stranded reads with default parameters. Mapped read counts were obtained using HTseq-count run in union mode. Results: We developed an approach for transcriptome-wide profiling of RNase L activity in human cells and identified hundreds of direct RNA targets and non-targets. We show that this RNase L-dependent decay (RLDD) selectively affects transcripts regulated by miR-17/miR-29/miR-200 and other microRNAs that function as suppressors of mammalian cell adhesion and proliferation. RNase L mimics the effects of these microRNAs and acts as a suppressor of proliferation and adhesion in mammalian cells.

Here, we observe that acquired resistance caused by the T790M gatekeeper mutation can occur either by selection of pre-existing T790M clones or via genetic evolution of initially T790M-negative drug tolerant cells. The path to resistance impacts the biology of the resistant clone, as those that evolved from drug tolerant cells had a diminished apoptotic response to third generation EGFR inhibitors that target T790M EGFR; treatment with navitoclax, an inhibitor of BCL-XL and BCL-2 restored sensitivity. We corroborated these findings using cultures derived directly from EGFR inhibitor-resistant patient tumors. These findings provide evidence that clinically relevant drug resistant cancer cells can both pre-exist and evolve from drug tolerant cells, and point to therapeutic opportunities to prevent or overcome resistance in the clinic."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75602GSE75606	DNA repair in species with extreme lifespan differences	"We compared RNA-seq expression patterns in liver, an organ with high oxidative metabolism and abundant spontaneous DNA damage, from humans, naked mole rats, and mice, differing in maximum lifespan over a range of ~100, 30, and 3 years, respectively, for 130 genes involved in DNA repair.

Most strikingly, co-expression of full length, wild type LDB1 increased LMO2 steady state abundance, whereas co-expression of mutant proteins deficient in LMO2 binding compromised LMO2 stability. These mutant LDB1 proteins also exerted dominant negative effects on growth and transcription in diverse leukemic cell lines.

Mutations in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are rare in Ewing sarcoma but the Wnt pathway modulator LGR5 is often highly expressed, suggesting a potential role for the axis in tumor pathogenesis. We evaluated beta-catenin and LGR5 expression in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and tumors and noted marked intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity. Tumors with evidence of active Wnt/beta-catenin signaling were associated with increased incidence of tumor relapse and worse overall survival. Paradoxically, RNA sequencing revealed a marked antagonism of EWS/ETS transcriptional activity in Wnt/beta-catenin activated tumor cells. Consistent with this, Wnt/beta-catenin activated cells displayed a phenotype that was reminiscent of Ewing sarcoma cells with partial EWS/ETS loss of function. Specifically, activation of Wnt/beta-catenin induced alterations to the actin cytoskeleton, acquisition of a migratory phenotype and up regulation of EWS/ETS-repressed genes. Notably, activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling led to marked induction of tenascin C (TNC), an established promoter of cancer metastasis, and an EWS/ETS-repressed target gene. Loss of TNC function in Ewing sarcoma cells profoundly inhibited their migratory and metastatic potential. Our studies reveal that heterogeneous activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in subpopulations of tumor cells contributes to phenotypic heterogeneity and disease progression in Ewing sarcoma. Significantly, this is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of EWS/ETS fusion protein function that results in de-repression of metastasis-associated gene programs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75859GSE75868	Molecular Criteria for Defining the Naive Human Pluripotent State	"Naive human pluripotent cells have been isolated in culture, but it remains unclear to what extent they resemble pluripotent cells in vivo. Here we present three lines of evidence indicating that naive pluripotent stem cells generated by small molecules share defining molecular signatures with the human preimplantation embryo. First, a comprehensive analysis of the transposcriptome reveals that naive human cells display a unique transposon expression profile of cleavage stage embryos. Second, induction of naive pluripotency is accompanied by a genome-wide depletion in DNA methylation that is reversible upon differentiation except at imprinted regions. Third, allele-specific analysis demonstrates that female naive cells exhibit an X chromosome signature of the human preimplantation embryo. However, when introduced into mouse embryos the naive cells failed to efficiently generate interspecies chimeras. Our work provides a set of molecular benchmarks for evaluating the developmental identity of distinct human pluripotent states captured in vitro."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75868GSE75906	Small molecules modulate chromatin accessibility to promote NEUROG2-mediated fibroblast-to-neuron reprogramming [RNA-seq]	"Pro-neural transcription factors and small molecules can induce the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into functional neurons; however, a molecular mechanism detailing the immediate-early events that catalyze this conversion has not been well defined. We previously demonstrated that NEUROG2, forskolin (F), and dorsomorphin (D) can induce functional neurons with high-efficiency. Here, we used this model to define the genetic and epigenetic events that initiate an acquisition of neuronal identity. We demonstrate that NEUROG2 is a pioneer factor, FD enhances both genome-wide NEUROG2 chromatin occupancy and H3K27 acetylation, and synergistic transcription by these factors is essential to successful reprogramming. CREB1, activated by FD, promotes neuron survival and acts with NEUROG2 to upregulate SOX4, which co-activates NEUROD1 and NEUROD4. In addition to this hierarchical function, SOX4 targets SWI/SNF subunits and SOX4 knockdown results in extensive loss of open chromatin and abolishes reprogramming. Applying these insights, adult human glioblastoma and skin fibroblast reprogramming was improved using SOX4, SMARCA4, and chromatin modifying chemicals."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75906GSE75935	Combined Genome and Transcriptome Sequencing to Identify Allelic Selection in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer	"Identifying genes where a variant allele is preferentially expressed in tumors could lead to a better understanding of cancer biology and optimization of targeted therapy. However, tumor sample heterogeneity complicates standard approaches for detecting preferential allele expression. We therefore developed a novel approach combining genome and transcriptome sequencing data from the same sample that corrects for sample heterogeneity and identifies significant preferentially expressed alleles. We applied this analysis to epithelial ovarian cancer samples consisting of matched primary ovary and peritoneum and lymph node metastasis. We find that preferentially expressed variant alleles include germline and somatic variants, are shared at a relatively high frequency between patients and are in gene networks known to be involved in cancer processes. Analysis at a patient level identifies patient-specific preferentially expressed alleles in genes that are targets for known drugs. Analysis at a site level identifies patterns of site specific preferential allele expression with similar pathways being impacted in the primary and metastasis sites. We conclude that genes with preferentially expressed variant alleles can act as cancer drivers and that targeting those alleles could lead to new therapeutic strategies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75935GSE75947	SPECtre: a spectral coherence-based classifier of actively translated transcripts from ribosome profiling sequence data	"Active protein translation can be assessed and measured using ribosome profiling sequencing strategies.

Here, we present an analytical tool that models the overall tri-nucleotide periodicity of ribosomal occupancy using a classifier based on spectral coherence. Our software, SPECtre, examines the relationship of normalized ribosome profiling read coverage over a rolling series of windows along a transcript against an idealized reference signal.

We determined global expression (RNA-seq) and genome wide profiles (ChIP-seq) of histone post-translational modifications and p53 binding in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) undergoing differentiation to define a high-confidence set of 40 lncRNAs, which are p53 transcriptional targets. We focused on lncRNAs, highly expressed in pluripotent hESCs and repressed by p53 during differentiation, to identify lncPRESS1 as a p53-regulated transcript that maintains hESC pluripotency in concert with core pluripotency factors. RNA-seq of hESCs depleted of lncPRESS1 revealed that lncPRESS1 controls a gene network that promotes pluripotency. Further, we found that lncPRESS1 physically interacts with SIRT6 to prevent SIRT6 chromatin localization and maintain high levels of histone H3K56 and H3K9 acetylation at promoters of pluripotency genes. In summary, we describe a novel pluripotency-specific lncRNA that safeguards the hESC state by disrupting SIRT6 activity"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76023GSE76025	Pluripotent stem cell disease modeling of GATA6 haploinsufficiency in human pancreatic development	"To better understand molecular mechanisms of human pancreatic development associated with GATA6 haploinsufficiency, we performed RNA-seq analysis to characterize the biological processes affected by GATA6 heterozygous mutation.

Typically, MSC are isolated from human tissue, expanded in culture and cryopreserved until usage. The safety and efficacy of MSC therapy will depend on the phenotypical and functional characteristics of MSC. The freeze-thawing procedure may change these characteristics. Furthermore, the microenvironment that the cells encounter after administration may impact the properties of MSC. It has been demonstrated that the large majority of MSC localize to the lungs after intravenous infusion, making this the site to study the effects of the in vivo milieu on administered MSC. In the present study we investigated the effect of freeze-thawing and of the mouse lung microenvironment on human adipose tissue-derived MSC. The effect of freeze-thawing on the whole genome expression profile of MSC was small and did not exceed inter-donor differences. There were no major changes in the expression of hemostatic regulators on transcriptional level, but significantly increased expression of procoagulant tissue factor on the surface of thawed adipose MSC, correlating with increased procoagulant activity of thawed cells after blood exposure in vitro and after infusion to mice. Exposure for 2h to the lung microenvironment had a major effect on MSC gene expression and affected several immunological and metabolic pathways. This indicates that MSC undergo functional changes shortly after infusion and this may influence the efficacy of MSC to modulate inflammatory responses. The results of this study demonstrate that MSC rapidly alter in response to the local milieu and that disease specific conditions may shape MSC after administration."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76081GSE76122	Transcriptomic analysis of human neural progenitor cells differentiation into astrocytes	"In this study we isolated and cultured neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from human fetal brain collected during the gliogenic phase (second trimester) of aborted fetuses, we differentiated NPCs into astrocyte using different protocols (FBS or CNTF/BMP4) and utilized RNA sequencing to analyze transcriptomic changes underlying the differentiation process"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76122GSE76151	Transcriptome profiling of hnRNP A2/B1 and A1 depleted cells	We used NEBNext UltraDirectionalRNA Library Prep Kits to prepare RNA-seq libraries of total RNA from hnRNP A2/B1 and A1 depleted A549 cells.

In mammals, EVs can mediate the horizontal transfer of various cargos and signaling molecules, notably miRNA and mRNA species. Whether this form of intercellular communication prevails in other metazoans remains unclear. Here, we report the first parallel comparative morphologic and transcriptomic characterization of EVs from Drosophila and human cellular models. Electronic microscopy revealed that Drosophila, like human cells release exosome-like EVs with diameter ranging from 30 to 200 nm, which contain complex populations of transcripts. RNA-seq identified abundant ribosomal RNA pseudogenes and retrotransposons in human and Drosophila EVs. Vault RNAs and Y RNAs abounded in human samples, whereas small nucleolar RNAs involved in pseudouridylation were most prevalent in Drosophila EVs. Numerous mRNAs were identified, largely consisting of exonic sequences displaying full-length read coverage and enriched for translation and electronic transport chain functions. By analogy with human systems, these extensive similarities suggest that EVs could also enable RNA-mediated intercellular communication in Drosophila."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76173GSE76199	Transcriptome profiling of Caki2 cells re-expressing Polybromo-1 (PBRM1)	PBRM1 is a component of the PBAF chromatin remodelling complex and has been observed to be deregulated in a significant proportion of patients with clear-cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC).

We developed a cell-sorting scheme to resolve myeloid (My), erythroid (Er), and megakaryocytic (Mk) fates from single CD34+ cells and then mapped the progenitor hierarchy across human development. Fetal liver contained large numbers of distinct oligopotent progenitors with intermingled My, Er and Mk fates. However, few oligopotent progenitor intermediates were present in the adult bone marrow. Instead only two progenitor classes predominate, multipotent and unipotent, with Er-Mk lineages emerging from multipotent cells.

Notably, destruction of one of these cell populations can stimulate repopulation via transdifferentiation of the other cell type, at least in mice, suggesting plasticity between these cell fates. Furthermore, dysfunction of both - and -cells contributes to the pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and -cell de-differentiation has been proposed to contribute to type 2 diabetes. Our objective was to delineate the molecular properties that maintain islet cell type specification yet allow for cellular plasticity. We hypothesized that correlating cell type-specific transcriptomes with an atlas of open chromatin will identify novel genes and transcriptional regulatory elements such as enhancers involved in - and -cell specification and plasticity. Methods: We sorted human a- and b-cells and performed the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and mRNA-seq, followed by integrative analysis to identify cell type-selective gene regulatory regions. Results: We identified numerous transcripts with either -cell- or -cell-selective expression and discovered the cell type-selective open chromatin regions that correlate with these gene activation patterns. We confirmed cell type-selective expression on the protein level for two of the top hits from our screen. The group specific protein (GC; or vitamin D binding protein) was restricted to a-cells, while CHODL (chondrolectin) immunoreactivity was only present in b-cells. Furthermore, -cell- and -cell-selective ATAC-seq peaks were identified to overlap with known binding sites for islet transcription factors, as well as with common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified as risk loci for type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: We have determined the genetic landscape of human - and -cells based on chromatin accessibility and transcript levels, which allowed for detection of novel - and -cell signature genes not previously known to be expressed in islets. Using fine-mapping of open chromatin, we have identified thousands of potential cis-regulatory elements that operate in an endocrine cell type-specific fashion."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76268GSE76284	Towards therapeutic application of pronuclear transfer to prevent transmission of mitochondrial DNA disease	"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are maternally inherited and are associated with a broad range of debilitating and fatal diseases. Assisted reproductive technologies designed to uncouple the inheritance of mtDNA from nuclear DNA may enable women who carry mtDNA mutations to have a genetically related child with a greatly reduced risk of disease. Here we report for the first time that pronuclear transplantation (PNT) between normally fertilised human zygotes provides an effective approach to preventing transmission of mtDNA disease. We found that the procedures previously used to perform PNT between abnormally fertilized human zygotes are highly inefficient when applied to those that undergo normal fertilization. We have therefore developed an alternative approach based on transplanting PN shortly after completion of the second meiotic division rather than shortly before onset of the first mitosis. This approach promotes highly efficient development to the blastocyst stage without affecting nuclear genome integrity. Furthermore, the expression profile of genes encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes was indistinguishable from unmanipulated control embryos. Importantly, levels of mtDNA transferred with the nuclear genome are below the threshold for mtDNA disease. Together these data indicate that transplantation of pronuclei early in the first cell cycle holds promise as a safe and effective approach to preventing transmission of mtDNA disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76284GSE76307	Differential RNA-seq analysis comparing APC-defective and APC-restored SW480 colorectal cancer cells	Identify genes that are differentially regulated as a consequence of restoration of full-length functional APC in a colorectal cancer cell lines.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76307GSE76308	Discovery of a Drug that Targets a Diabetes Gene identified by GWAS	"A robust system using disease relevant cells to systematically evaluate the role in diabetes for loci identified through genome wide association studies (GWAS) is urgently needed.

Even at relatively low cumulative doses of 200250 mg/m2, the risk of cardiotoxicity is estimated at 7.8%% to 8.8%%4,5.

At present, it is not possible to predict which patients will be affected by DIC or adequately protect patients who are at risk for suffering this devastating side-effect8. Here we demonstrate that patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) can recapitulate individual patients predilection to DIC at the single cell level. hiPSC-CMs derived from breast cancer patients who suffered clinical DIC are consistently more sensitive to doxorubicin toxicity, demonstrating decreased cell viability, mitochondrial/metabolic function, calcium handling, and antioxidant pathway gene expression, along with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production compared to hiPSC-CMs from patients who did not experience DIC.

To determine the transcriptional target(s) of FOXE3 that are indispensable for the anterior segment development, we examined the transcriptome and the proteome of cells expressing truncated FOXE3 responsible for Peters anomaly identified through linkage-coupled next-generation whole exome sequencing. We found that DNAJB1, an autophagy-associated protein, was the only candidate exhibiting differential expression in both screens. We confirmed the candidacy of DNAJB1 through chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays while knockdown of DNAJB1 in human lens epithelial cells resulted in mitotic arrest. Subsequently, we targeted dnajb1a in zebrafish through injection of a splice-blocking morpholino. The dnajb1a morphants exhibited underdeveloped cataractous lenses with persistent apoptotic nuclei.

This ensures stimulus and subtype-specific transcriptional responses. Expanding on the function of CTCF and the cohesin complex in breast cancer, we demonstrate that the chromatin-looping factor ZNF143 binds the promoter of most early-response estrogen target genes connected to distal regulatory elements in ESR1-positive breast cancer cells. Its chromatin occupancy is unaffected by estrogen stimulation, supporting a stable three-dimensional genomic architecture within the early response to estrogen. Its loss abrogates the estrogen-induced transcriptional response and growth of breast cancer cells. When taking into account CTCF, ZNF143 and cohesin complex subunits, we show that chromatin-looping factors are genetically altered in over 20%% of ESR1-positive primary breast tumors. Furthermore, the overexpression of ZNF143, CTCF and RAD21, a cohesin complex subunit, in ESR1-positive breast tumors associates with a worse clinical outcome. Overall, our results suggest that ZNF143 is a new critical effector of the estrogen response and highlights the contribution of the chromatin looping machinery to ESR1-positive breast cancer development."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76453GSE76464	"Epigenetic regulation of the apoptosis program in t(8;21) AMLs by an AML1-ETO, ERG and RUNX1 triad"	"The t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia associated oncoprotein AML1-ETO is a transcription factor that aberrantly regulates the pathways that lead to myeloid differentiation. Here, we set out to investigate the effects of AML1-ETO on gene expression and the epigenome in patient blast cells. We identify two modules, one in which AML1-ETO binds promoter regions of active genes and one represented by non-promoter binding to accessible, yet inactive chromatin regions. Using genome-wide binding analysis and mass spectrometry interaction studies we identify ERG, FLI1, TAL1 and RUNX1 as common binding factors of all AML1-ETO occupied genomic regions, while LYL1 and LMO2 show preferential binding in the context of non promoter regions. Epigenetically, reduced histone acetylation levels at non-promoter regions seems HDAC dependent, as treatment with an HDACi increases acetylation and induces cell death. Both AML1-ETO modules are represented in most aberrantly regulated pathways, including many signaling pathways, self-renewal and apoptosis. For the latter, the expression of the wild type transcription factors RUNX1 and ERG is required, as alterations in expression are associated with the onset of an apoptosis program. Interestingly, upon RUNX1 or ERG knockdown this onset seems to be dependent on increased AML1-ETO expression as combinatorial knockdown of RUNX1/AML1-ETO or ERG/AML1-ETO results in rescue from apoptosis.

The patients carry the expansion of over 200 CGG repeats located at the 5 untranslated region of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1). As a result, the FMR1 promoter becomes hypermethylated leading to decreased or absent expression of its encoded RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). We previously generated human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from fibroblasts of a FXS patient (FXS-iPSC) with expanded CGG-repeats at the FMR1 promoter. In the present work, we explored the transcriptional misregulation during the embryonic neurogenesis by in-vitro differentiation of FXS-iPSC into neurons through the intermediate stages. At each differentiation stage, we collected RNA and performed RNA-seq. After an integrated analysis, we found up-regulation of many genes encoding TFs for neuronal differentiation (WNT1, BMP4, POU3F4, TFAP2C, and PAX3), down-regulation of potassium channels (KCNA1, KCNC3, KCNG2, KCNIP4, KCNJ3, KCNK9, and KCNT1) and altered temporal regulation of SHANK1 and NNAT in FXS-iPSC derived neurons, indicating impaired neuronal differentiation and function in FXS patients. Furthermore, we found the cholesterol synthesis genes (e.g., SQLE, LSS, and FASN) are up-regulated during the in-vitro neuronal differentiation of FXS-iPSC, which may contribute to the obesity phenotype of FXS patients.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this activation remain elusive. Here we show that G9a functions as a bona fide coactivator of the endogenous estrogen receptor  (ER) in breast cancer cells in a histone methylation-independent manner. G9a dimethylates ER protein at lysine 235 both in vitro and in cells. Dimethylation of ERK235 (ERK235me2) is recognized by the Tudor domain of PHF20, which in turn recruits the MOF histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex to ER target gene promoters to deposit histone H4K16 acetylation promoting active transcription. Together, our in vitro and in vivo data establish the molecular mechanism by which G9a functions as an ER coactivator. Along with the PHF20/MOF complex, G9a links the crosstalk between ER methylation and histone acetylation governing the epigenetic regulation of hormonal gene expression."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76507GSE76514	Laser-capture microscopy coupled with Smart-seq2 (LCM-seq) for robust and efficient transcriptomic profiling of mouse and human tissues	"Generally, when LCM is used in diverse transcriptomic analyses, several hundred, if not thousands, of cells are needed to obtain high quality of RNA-seq data. As some cellular populations are very small and tissue often in scarcity, we aimed to carefully document the lowest number of cells needed to retrieve sequencable libraries. We started with capturing 120 cells and subsequently scaled down to 50 cells, 30 cells, 10 cells, 5 cells, 2 cells and finally 1 cell. By optimizing multiple steps in the procedure, including direct lysis of cells without performing RNA isolation, we developed LCM-seq that couples LCM with Smart-seq2 for robust and efficient polyA-based RNA sequencing.

We have discovered a repressor complex composed of TBX3 and CAPERa which functions upstream of the RB and p53 effector pathways and is required to prevent senescence of primary cells and in mouse embryos. TBX3/ CAPERa directly binds and represses transcription and chromatin structure of genes in multiple senescence pathways and the LncRNA UCA1, which we have identified as a novel tumor suppressor. The TBX3/ CAPERa complex is physically disrupted in oncogene induced senescence, providing a new molecular mechanism for derepression of prosenescence pathways in this system.

"It has become increasingly clear that proper cellular control of pluripotency and differentiation is related to the regulation of rRNA synthesis. To further our understanding of the role that the regulation of rRNA synthesis has on pluripotency we monitored the reduction of rRNA synthesis after the induction of endoderm-specific gene expression in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using a brief Activin A treatment. We discovered that the reduction in rRNA synthesis during directed differentiation is rapid (within 6 hours of Activin A treatment), correlates with a reduction in the binding of UBTF, and precedes heterochromatin formation throughout the rRNA gene. The loss of pluripotency and the induction of lineage specific gene expression markers can be induced by reducing rRNA synthesis directly with the Pol I inhibitor, CX-5461. Activin A and CX-5461 both appear to reduce pluripotency and alter lineage-specific transcription, but likely do so via distinct mechanisms."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76586GSE76626	Characterization of EZH2-deficient human embryonic stem cells [ChIP-seq and bulk RNA-seq]	Here we analyze histone modifications and transcriptome profiles of EZH2-deficient human embroynic stem cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76626GSE76627	The human cellular nucleic acid binding protien binds G-rich elements close to translation initiation sires and promotes translation. [RNA-Seq]	"CNBP is a eukaryote-conserved nucleic-acid binding protein required in mammals for embryonic development. It contains seven CCHC-type zinc-finger domains and was suggested to act as a nucleic acid chaperone, as well as a transcription factor. Here, we identify all CNBP isoforms as cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding proteins. Using Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside Enhanced Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation, we mapped its binding sites on RNA at nucleotide-level resolution on a genome-wide scale and find that CNBP interacted with 3961 mRNAs in human cell lines, preferentially at a G-rich motif close to the AUG start codon on mature mRNAs. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses coupled with system-wide RNA and protein quantification revealed that CNBP did not affect RNA abundance, but rather promoted translation of its targets. This is consistent with an RNA chaperone function of CNBP helping to resolve secondary structures, thus promoting translation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76627GSE76656	Multiplex enhancer-reporter assays uncover unsophisticated p53 enhancer logic [RNA-seq]	"Analysis of p53 binding sites using multiplex enhancer reporter assays, ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq data. Transcription factors establish and maintain the specific transcriptome of a cell by binding to genomic regulatory regions, thereby regulating the transcription of their target genes. Like many transcription factors, the DNA sequence-specific binding preferences of p53 are known. However, it remains largely unclear what distinguishes functional enhancers from other bound genomic regions that have no regulatory activity. In addition, the genome is scattered with seemingly perfect recognition sequences that remain unoccupied. To disentangle the rules of genome-wide p53 binding, we employed two complementary techniques of multiplex enhancer-reporter assays, one using barcoded reporters and the other using enhancer self-transcription. We compared the activity of more than one thousand candidate p53 enhancers under loss and gain of p53 conditions and identified several hundred high-confidence p53-responsive enhancers. Strikingly, the large majority (99%%) of these target enhancers can be characterized and distinguished from negative sequences by the occurrence of a single p53 binding site. By training a machine learning classifier on these data, and integrating the resulting genome-wide predictions with fifteen publicly available human p53 ChIP-seq data sets, we identified a consensus set of 1148 functional p53 binding sites in the human genome. Unexpectedly, this direct p53 cistrome is invariably used between cell types and experimental conditions, while differences between experiments can be largely attributed to indirect non-functional binding. Our data suggest that direct p53 enhancers function in a context-independent manner and do not contain obvious combinatorial complexity of binding sites for multiple transcription factors. They represent a class of unsophisticated cell-autonomous enhancers with a single binding site, distinct from complex developmental enhancers that integrate signals from multiple transcription factors. This suggests that context-dependent regulation of p53 target genes is not encoded in the p53 enhancer, but at different upstream or downstream layers of the cell's gene regulatory network."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76656GSE76661	RPA interacts with HIRA and regulates H3.3 deposition at gene regulatory elements in mammalian cells	"The incorporation of histone variant H3.3 has been implicated in the formation and maintenance of specialized chromatin structure in metazoan cells. H3.3 is enriched in promoters, regulatory elements and genebody, and HIRA is required for H3.3 enrichment in these regions. But the mechanism of regulating H3.3 deposition by HIRA remains elusive. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators, we identify single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA as being critically required for deposition of newly synthesized H3.3. RPA interacts with HIRA and H3.3 and co-localizes with HIRA at gene promoters and some regulatory elements across genome wide. Deletion of RPA dramatically reduces the enrichment of HIRA and newly synthesized H3.3 at these regions and reduced nascent anti-sense transcription. Taken together, our data demonstrate that RPA functions as new regulator of H3.3 deposition in promoter and some regulatory elements by recruiting HIRA and reveal a novel mechanism for RPA in chromatin and gene regulation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76661GSE76682	RNA-seq expression data from EB-HSPC after AM580 treatment compated to DMSO-trated and FL-HSPCs	RA signalling regulated endothelial to hematopoietic transition and HSC generation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76682GSE76683	RNA-seq expression data from FL-HSPCs after HOXA7 knockdown	"HOXA7 regulates FL-HSPC self-renewal in vitro and in vivo.

"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein coding RNAs regulating gene expression. Although for some lncRNAs a relevant role in hypoxic endothelium has been shown, the regulation and function of lncRNAs is still largely unknown in the vascular physio-pathology. Taking advantage of next-generation sequencing techniques, transcriptomic changes induced by endothelial cell exposure to hypoxia were investigated. Paired-end sequencing of polyadenylated RNA derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to 1%% O2 or normoxia was performed. Bioinformatics analysis identified  2000 differentially expressed genes, including 122 lncRNAs. Extensive validation was performed by both microarray and qPCR. Among the validated lncRNAs, H19, MIR210HG, MEG9, MALAT1 and MIR22HG were also induced in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. To test the functional relevance of lncRNAs in endothelial cells, knockdown of H19 expression was performed. H19 inhibition decreased HUVEC growth, inducing their accumulation in G1 phase of the cell cycle; accordingly, p21 (CDKN1A) expression was increased. Additionally, H19 knockdown also diminished HUVEC ability to form capillary like structures when plated on matrigel.

Although recent large-scale genomic analysis has improved the description of the genetic abnormalities of ESCC, few targetable genomic lesions were identified and no molecular-based therapy is available. To identify druggable candidates in this tumor, we performed high-throughput small-molecule inhibitor screening. The unbiased results led us to discover a highly potent anti-ESCC compound, THZ1, a newly developed covalent CDK7 inhibitor. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that THZ1 has powerful anti-neoplastic properties against ESCC cells with minimal toxic effect on healthy tissues. Importantly, whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed that low-dose THZ1 treatment led to selective inhibition of a number of oncogenic transcripts. Notably, further characterization of the genomic features of these THZ1-sensitive transcripts demonstrated that they were frequently associated with Super-Enhancer (SE). Moreover, SE analysis alone uncovered many lineage-specific master regulators in ESCC. Finally, integrative analysis of both THZ1-sensitive and SE-associated transcripts identified a number of novel oncogenes in the context of ESCC, such as PAK4, RUNX1, DNAJB1, SREBF2 and YAP1, with PAK4 being a potential druggable kinase. Together, our integrative molecular approaches identified a catalog of SE-associated lineage-specific master regulators and oncogenic transcripts in ESCC, which will significantly promote the understanding of ESCC biology.

Following transcription of the HIV-1 genome, its primary transcript is processed to produce dozens of distinct mRNAs through the alternative use of splice sites. Results: 1C8 decreases the activity of SRSF10, a cellular protein that controls the selection of splice sites in HIV-1 transcripts. 1C8 decreases the phosphorylation of SRSF10, and this change is associated with alterations in the interaction of SRSF10 with HIV-1 transcripts and factors that control splice site selection.

This has led to a search for growth conditions that support self-renewal of hESCs akin to hypomethylated nave epiblast cells in human pre-implantation embryos. We have discovered that reverting primed hESCs to a hypomethylated nave state or deriving a new hESC line under nave conditions results in the establishment of Stage Specific Embryonic Antigen 4 (SSEA4) negative hESC lines with a transcriptional program resembling the human pre-implantation epiblast. In contrast, we discovered that the methylome of nave hESCs in vitro is distinct from the human epiblast in vivo with loss of DNA methylation at primary imprints and a lost 'memory' of the methylation state of the human oocyte. This failure to recover the nave epiblast methylation landscape appears to be a consistent feature of self-renewing hypomethylated nave hESCs in vitro."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76970GSE76987	Gene signature in sessile serrated polyps identifies colon cancer subtype	"RNA sequencing analysis of gene expression in serrated colon polyps, uninvolved colon and control colon"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76987GSE77032	"Total RNA sequencing of HCT116 cells with vitamin C, 5-Aza-CdR and combination treatment compared to untreated cells I"	"Total RNA sequenceing method was used to compare the differential expression of genes in HCT116 cells with vitamin C, 5-Aza-CdR and combination treatment compared to untreated cells"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77032GSE77033	nanoCAGE reveals 5 UTR features that define specific modes of translation of functionally related mTOR-sensitive mRNAs	"mTOR regulates mRNA translation. Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that mTOR exclusively stimulates translation of TOP (containing a 5-terminal oligopyrimidine [5TOP] motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling implied that mTOR also modulates translation of non-TOP mRNAs. We show that ribosome-, but not polysome-profiling, is biased towards identification of TOP mRNAs as differentially translated while obscuring detection of changes in non-TOP mRNA translation. Transcription start site profiling by Nano-Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (nanoCAGE) revealed that many mTOR-sensitive mRNAs do not have 5TOP motifs. Moreover, nanoCAGE showed that 5 UTR features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of mTOR-sensitive mRNAs: i) those with short 5 UTRs enriched for mitochondrial functions such as respiration, that are translated in an eIF4E, but not eIF4A1-dependent manner and ii) mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, that harbor long 5 UTRs, and require both eIF4E and eIF4A1 for their efficient translation. Selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs harboring long 5 UTRs via suppression of eIF4A leads to uncoupling of expression of proteins involved in respiration (e.g. ATP5O) from those protecting mitochondrial integrity (e.g. BCL-2) ultimately resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous translational downregulation of both long and short 5 UTR mRNAs by mTOR inhibitors results in suppression of mitochondrial respiration and predominantly cytostatic effects. Therefore, 5 UTR features define differential modes of translation of functionally distinct mTOR-sensitive mRNAs, which explains discrepancies between the effects of mTOR and eIF4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77033GSE77039	Distinct gene regulatory programs define the inhibitory effects of LXRs and PPARG on cancer cell proliferation	"The liver x receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) nuclear receptor transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of energy homeostasis that impact tumor cell metabolism and proliferation. To better define the underlying molecular processes governing the genetic control of cellular growth in response to extracellular metabolic signals, we performed a comprehensive, genome-wide characterization of the temporal regulatory cascades mediated by LXR and PPARG signaling in HT29 colorectal cancer cells. For this analysis we applied a multi-tiered approach that incorporated cellular phenotypic assays, gene expression profiles, chromatin state dynamics and nuclear receptor binding patterns. By integrating these orthogonal datasets over time, we uncovered the regulatory architecture of LXR and PPARG activity. Both sets of nuclear receptors inhibited cell proliferation and increased cellular oxidative stress, validating results from independent studies. Despite this metabolic reprogramming, the gene regulatory network programs initiated by these nuclear receptors were widely distinct. PPARG generated a rapid and short-term response while maintaining a gene activator role. By contrast, LXR signaling was prolonged, with initial, predominantly activating functions altering to repressive gene regulatory activities at late time points through RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) promoter pausing. This exhaustive dataset illustrates the complexity of genome function and structure by elucidating how common phenotypic outcomes are genetically encoded through diverse transcriptional programs.

Structurally, high-density hESCs relocalize their TGF- receptors to their lateral side in the center of the colony, while maintaining apical localization of receptors at the edge. This relocalization insulates central cells from apically applied ligands while maintaining response to basally presented ones.

Sequins have an entirely artificial sequence with no homology to natural reference genomes, but align to gene loci encoded on an artificial in silico chromosome. The combination of multiple sequins across a range of concentrations emulates alternative splicing and differential gene expression, and provides scaling factors for normalization between samples. We demonstrate the use of sequins in RNA-seq experiments to measure sample-specific biases and determine the limits of reliable transcript assembly and quantification in accompanying human RNA samples. In addition, we have designed a complementary set of sequins that represent fusion genes arising from rearrangements of the in silico chromosome to aid in cancer diagnosis.

We investigated the technical variation associated with sample processing using the single cell Fluidigm C1 platform. To do so, we processed three C1 replicates from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to all samples, to account for amplification bias. We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts are not an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels. Based on our results, we suggest a framework for effective scRNA-seq studies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77288GSE77308	Loss of CSL unlocks a hypoxic response and enhanced tumor growth potential in breast cancer cells	"Notch signaling is an important regulator of stem cell differentiation. All canonical Notch signaling is transmitted through the DNA-binding protein CSL and hyperactivated Notch signaling is associated with tumor development; thus it may be anticipated that CSL deficiency should reduce tumor growth. In contrast, we report that genetic removal of CSL in breast tumor cells caused accelerated growth of xenografted tumors. Loss of CSL unleashed a hypoxic response during normoxic conditions, manifested by stabilization of the HIF1 protein and acquisition of a polyploid giant-cell, cancer stem cell-like, phenotype. At the transcriptome level, loss of CSL upregulated more than 1750 genes and less than 3%% of those genes were part of the Notch transcriptional signature. Collectively, this suggests that CSL exerts functions beyond serving as the central node in the Notch signaling cascade and reveals a novel role for CSL in tumorigenesis and regulation of the cellular hypoxic response."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77308GSE77347	Ribosomal footprinting of MDA_Ctrl and MDA_Glu overexpression cell lines	We used Illlumina Artseq Ribo Profile to perform ribosome footprinting on the above cell lines	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77347GSE77370	Negative control of CSL gene transcription by stress/DNA damage response and p53 [RNA-Seq]	"CSL is a key transcription factor, mostly acting as a repressor. While known as main effector of Notch signaling, it can also play Notch-independent functions. Despite the wide interest in CSL, the mechanisms responsible for its own regulation have been little studied. We recently showed that CSL down-modulation in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) leads to conversion into cancer associated fibroblasts, which promote keratinocyte tumor development. We show here that levels of CSL gene transcription differ among HDF strains derived from many different individuals, with negative correlation with genes involved in DNA damage/repair. CSL expression in all tested strains is negatively regulated by stress / DNA damaging insults caused by UVA, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), smoke extract and doxorubicin treatment. p53, a key effector of the DNA damage response, functions as common negative regulator of CSL gene transcription, through both suppression of CSL promoter activity and, indirectly, through increased p21 expression. CSL was previously shown to bind p53 suppressing its activity. The present findings indicate that p53, in turn, decreases CSL expression, which can serve to enhance p53 activity in the acute response of cells to DNA damaging cancer-threatening conditions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77370GSE77408			GSE77443	Cell fusion-mediated pluripotent reprogramming triggers ordered changes in chromatin and gene expression across the human inactive X chromosome	"Erasure of epigenetic memory is required to convert somatic cells towards pluripotency. Reactivation of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) has been used to model epigenetic reprogramming in mouse, but human studies are hampered by Xi epigenetic instability and difficulties in tracking partially reprogrammed iPSCs. Here we used cell fusion to examine the earliest events in the reprogramming-induced Xi reactivation of human female fibroblasts. We show a rapid and widespread loss of Xi-associated H3K27me3 and XIST in fused cells that precedes the bi-allelic expression of selected Xi-genes by many heterokaryons (30-50%%). After cell division, RNA-FISH and RNA-Seq analysis confirmed that Xi reactivation remained partial and showed that induction of human pluripotency-specific XACT transcripts occurred, but was rare (1%%). These data effectively separate pre- and post-mitotic events in reprogramming-induced Xi reactivation, and suggest a hierarchy where early events such as XIST-delocalisation, are required but are insufficient to establish stable human X reactivation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77443GSE77460	Differential Gene Expression Time Course of Normal Human Immortalized (iPrECs) vs Tumorigenic (EMP-iPrECs) Prostate Epithelial Cells during In Vitro Prostate Epithelial Cell Differentiation	"The first goal of this project was to identify differentially expressed genes associated with human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) differentiation over a 2+ week time course that are associated with and potentially required for normal PrEC differentiation (J Cell Sci 123:266-76, 2010). The second goal was to determine how these differentially expressed genes are changed when the same cells are transformed into tumorigenic cells (EMP-iPrECs) through overexpression of Erg, Myc, and shRNA to Pten (Cancer Res 74:3357-68, 2014). In the iPrECs, we readily identified many genes that were up and down regulated over time during differentiation. Genes that decreased include many cell cycle genes, and genes that increased include known differentiation markers. The EMP cells did not differentiate as previously reported and was supported by the general lack of any major changes in gene expression over the EMP time course. When iPrECs were compared to EMPs, there were over 2000 differentially expressed genes that did not overlap with the differentially expressed genes identified during the normal differentiation time course. Thus, oncogenic transformation of PrECs results in major gene expression changes and abrogates the differentiation program."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77460GSE77513	Capturing the biology of mild versus severe disease in a pluripotent stem cell-based model of Familial Dysautonomia	"Familial Dysautonomia is a genetic disease, however patietns with the same genotype present with mild or severe forms of the disease.

However, neuronal conversion is relatively inefficient in human cells compared to mouse cells. It has been unclear what might be the key barriers to reprogramming in human cells. We recently elucidated an RNA program mediated by the polypyrimidine tract binding protein PTB to convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into functional neurons. In human adult fibroblasts (HAFs), however, we unexpectedly found that invoking the documented PTBRESTmiR-124 loop generates only immature neurons. We now report that the functionality requires sequential inactivation of PTB and the PTB paralog nPTB in HAFs. Inactivation of nPTB triggers another self-enforcing loop essential for neuronal maturation, which comprises nPTB, the transcription factor BRN2, and miR-9. These findings suggest that two separate gatekeepers control neuronal conversion and maturation and consecutively overcoming these gatekeepers enables deterministic reprogramming of HAFs into functional neurons."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77523GSE77538	Genome-wide expression profile in FH-deficient (UOK262) vs FH-competent (UOK262pFH) human cells derived from metastatsis to the mediastinum of a HLRCC patient	"Comparison of the transcriptome of human kideny cancer cells either wild-type for FH or FH-deficient.

We define N-Myc and activated AKT1 as oncogenic components sufficient to transform human prostate epithelial cells to prostate adenocarcinoma and NEPC including the small cell prostate carcinoma (SCPC) variant with phenotypic and molecular features of aggressive, late-stage human disease. We directly show that prostate adenocarcinoma and NEPC can both arise from a common epithelial clone. Further, N-Myc is required for tumor maintenance and destabilization of N-Myc through Aurora A kinase inhibition reduces tumor burden.

Elucidating their molecular profiles, and how these contrast with colorectal cancer (CRC), offers the opportunity to understand their biology and how they are able to grow to such large lesions without progressing to cancer. Profiling of 11 LSTs with multiple genome-wide approaches showed mutation rates comparable with microsatellite stable CRCs at 2.4 versus 2.6 mutations per megabase respectively, however copy number alterations are infrequent (averaging 1.5 per LST). Only 28.5%% of genes with promoter CpG island hypermethylation showed >2-fold downregulation of expression in LST tissue relative to paired normal mucosa. Integration of genetic and epigenetic data identified driver genes not previously implicated in colorectal neoplasia (ANO5, MED12L, EPB41L4A, RGMB, SLITRK1, NRXN1, ANK2), including genes targeted by both genetic and epigenetic alterations. Alterations to pathways commonly mutated in CRCs, namely the p53, PI3K and TGFb pathways, are rare. Instead LST-altered genes converge on axonal guidance, Wnt and actin cytoskeleton signalling. Non-granular morphology, which is associated with an elevated risk of cancer, correlates with low frequencies of epigenetic inactivation and KRAS mutations and the hyperactivation of CXCR4 signalling. These data show that mutation load is a poor predictor of invasive potential and that genomic structural aberrations or alterations in key pathways is important in progression to cancer.

TCF4 is a complex locus expressing multiple transcripts by alternative splicing and use of multiple promoters. We report a three-generation family segregating mild intellectual disability with an apparently balanced chromosomal translocation t(14;18)(q23.3;q21.2) that we characterized as a complex unbalanced karyotype 46,XY,der(14)del(14)(q23.3q23.3)t(14;18)(q23.3;q21.2)del(18)(q21.2q21.2) del(18)(q21.2q21.2)inv(18)(q21.2q21.2),der(18)t(14 ;18)(q23.3;q21.2) disrupting TCF4. Using whole genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, qRT-PCR and nCounter analysis, we characterized the breakpoint junctions from derivative chromosomes and gene expression at the TCF4 locus. Our analyses revealed that family members segregating mild intellectual disability with the complex chromosome aberration had normal expression of genes along chromosomes 14 or 18 and no marked changes in expression of genes other than TCF4. Affected individuals had 12-33 fold higher mRNA levels of TCF4 than did unaffected controls or individuals with PTHS. Increased levels of TCF4 transcript variants originating distal to the translocation breakpoint, not the fusion transcript generated by the derivative chromosome, contributed to this increased. Although validation in additional patients is required, our findings suggest that the dysmorphic features and severe intellectual disability characteristic of PTHS is partially rescued by overexpression of short TCF4 transcripts encoding a nuclear localization signal, a transcription activation domain, and the basic helix-loop-helix domain."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77742GSE77784	MOF acetyl transferase regulates transcription and respiration in mitochondria	"Histone acetylation is sensitive to metabolic cues, however interplay between histone acetyl transferases and cellular metabolism remains poorly understood. Here we report the localization of a classical nuclear HAT- MOF and members of Non-Specific Lethal complex in mitochondria. MOF regulates expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, residing in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, selectively in aerobically respiring cells. Furthermore, MOF/KANSL1 depletion causes impaired mitochondrial translation and reduced respiration. MOF loss is catastrophic for tissues with high-energy consumption. In mouse hearts, Mof knockout causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, compromised ventricular contractility/ stroke volume and ultimately leads to cardiac failure within three weeks of birth. RNA-seq analysis of the cardiomyocytes revealed deregulation of mitochondrial nutrient metabolism and OXPHOS pathways. Consistently, electron microscopy on affected tissues revealed mitochondrial deterioration with high tissue heterogeneity, commonly observed in mitochondrial diseases. Thus, we reveal a novel function of MOF in mitochondrial homeostasis and propose MOF as a sensor connecting epigenetic regulation to metabolism."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77784GSE77808	IL-15 activates mTOR and primes stress-activated gene-expression leading to prolonged anti-tumor capacity of NK cells	"Treatment of hematological malignancies by adoptive transfer of activated natural killer (NK) cells is limited by poor post-infusion persistence. We compared the ability of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 to sustain human NK cell functions following cytokine withdrawal to model post-infusion performance. In contrasts to IL-2, IL-15 mediated stronger signaling through the IL-2/15 receptor complex and provided functional advantages. Genome-wide analysis of cytosolic and polysome-associated mRNA revealed cytokine dependent differential mRNA levels and translation during cytokine activation but also that most gene expression differences were primed by IL-15 and only manifested after cytokine withdrawal. IL-15 augmented mTOR signaling, which correlated with increased expression of genes related to cell metabolism and respiration. Consistently, mTOR inhibition abrogated IL-15-induced functional advantages. Moreover, mTOR-independent STAT-5 signaling contributed to improved NK cell function during cytokine activation but not following cytokine withdrawal. The superior performance of IL-15 stimulated NK cells was also observed using a clinically applicable protocol for NK cell expansion. Finally, expression of IL-15 correlated with cytolytic immune functions in patients with B cell lymphoma and favorable clinical outcome. These findings highlight the importance of mTOR regulated metabolic processes for immune cell functions and argue for implementation of IL-15 in adoptive NK cell cancer therapy."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77808GSE77913	Cajal bodies are linked to genome conformation [RNA-Seq]	"The mechanisms underlying nuclear body (NB) formation and their contribution to genome function are unknown. We examined the non-random positioning of Cajal bodies (CBs), major NBs involved in spliceosomal snRNP assembly, and their role in genome organization. CBs are predominantly located at the periphery of chromosome territories at a multi-chromosome interface. Genome-wide chromatin conformation capture analysis (4C-seq) using CB-interacting loci revealed that CB-associated regions are enriched with highly expressed histone genes and U small nuclear and nucleoar RNA (sn/snoRNA) loci that form intra- and inter-chromosomal clusters. We observed a number of CB-dependent gene positioning events on chromosome 1. RNAi-mediated disassembly of CBs disrupts the CB-targeting gene clusters and suppresses the expression of U sn/snoRNA and histone genes. This loss of spliceosomal snRNP production resulted in increased splicing noise, even in CB-distal regions.

Here, we performed comprehensive mutational analysis of primary and relapse APL to identify somatic alterations which cooperate with PML-RARA in the pathogenesis of APL. We explored the mutational landscape using whole-exome (n=12) and subsequent targeted sequencing of 398 genes in 153 primary and 69 relapse APL. Both primary and relapse APL harbored an average of eight non-silent somatic mutations per exome. We observed recurrent alterations of FLT3, WT1, NRAS and KRAS in the newly diagnosed APL, while mutations in other genes commonly mutated in myeloid leukemia were rarely detected. The molecular signature of APL relapse was characterized by emergence of frequent mutations in PML and RARA genes. Our sequencing data also demonstrates incidence of loss-of-function mutations in previously unidentified genes, ARID1B and ARID1A, both of which encode for key components of the SWI/SNF complex.

One of the most prevalent modified bases is found at the 5 end of mRNA, at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap. Here we show that this nucleotide, N6,2-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), is a reversible modification that influences cellular mRNA fate. Using a transcriptome-wide map of m6Am we find that m6Am-initiated transcripts are markedly more stable than mRNAs that begin with other nucleotides. We show that the enhanced stability of m6Am-initiated transcripts is due to resistance to the mRNA-decapping enzyme DCP2. Moreover, we find that m6Am is selectively demethylated by fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). FTO preferentially demethylates m6Am rather than N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and reduces the stability of m6Am mRNAs. Together, these findings show that the methylation status of m6Am in the 5 cap is a dynamic and reversible epitranscriptomic modification that determines mRNA stability."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78040GSE78078	miR-126 Orchestrates an Oncogenic Program in B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	"MicroRNA (miRNA)-126 is a known regulator of hematopoietic stem cell quiescence.

Mechanisms of action of DUX4 are currently unknown. Using immortalized human myoblasts with a titratable DUX4 transgene, we identify by mass spectrometry an interaction between the DUX4 C-terminus and the histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that DUX4 recruits p300 to its target gene, ZSCAN4, displaces histone H3 from the center of its binding site, and induces H3K27Ac in its vicinity, but C-terminal deleted DUX4 does not. We show that a DUX4 minigene, bearing only the homeodomains and C-terminus, is transcriptionally functional and cytotoxic, and that overexpression of a nuclear targeted C-terminus impairs the ability of WT DUX4 to interact with p300 and to regulate target genes. Genomic profiling of DUX4, histone H3, and H3 modifications reveals that DUX4 binds two classes of locus: DNase accessible H3K27Ac-rich chromatin and inaccessible H3K27Ac-depleted MaLR-enriched chromatin. At this latter class, it acts as a pioneer factor, recruiting H3K27 acetyltransferase activity and opening the locus for transcription. In concert with local increased H3K27Ac, the strong H3K27Ac peaks at distant sites are significantly depleted of H3K27Ac, thus DUX4 uses its C-terminus to induce a global reorganization of H3K27 acetylation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78158GSE78167	An integrative transcriptomics approach identifies miR-503 as a candidate master regulator of the estrogen response [RNA-seq]	"Estrogen receptor  (ER) is an important biomarker of breast cancer severity and a common therapeutic target. Recent studies have demonstrated that in addition to its role in promoting proliferation, ER also protects tumors against metastatic transformation. Current therapeutics antagonize ER and interfere with both beneficial and detrimental signaling pathways stimulated by ER. The goal of this study is to uncover the dynamics of coding and non-coding RNA (microRNA) expression in response to estrogen stimulation and identify potential therapeutic targets that more specifically inhibit ER-stimulated growth and survival pathways without interfering with its protective features. To achieve this, we exposed MCF7 cells (an estrogen receptor positive model cell line for breast cancer) to estrogen and prepared a time course of paired mRNA and miRNA sequencing libraries at ten time points throughout the first 24 hours of the response to estrogen. From these data, we identified three primary expression trendstransient, induced, and repressedthat were each enriched for genes with distinct cellular functions. Integrative analysis of paired mRNA and microRNA temporal expression profiles identified miR-503 as the strongest candidate master regulator of the estrogen response, in part through suppression of ZNF217an oncogene that is frequently amplified in cancer. We confirmed experimentally that miR-503 directly targets ZNF217 and that over-expression of miR-503 suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation. Overall, these data indicate that miR-503 acts as a potent estrogen-induced tumor suppressor microRNA that opposes cellular proliferation and has promise as a therapeutic for breast cancer.

However, factors influencing innate sensitivity remain incompletely catalogued. We analyzed the somatic mutanomes and transcriptomes of pretreatment melanoma biopsies. Mutations in cell adhesion genes and the DNA repair gene BRCA2 were enriched in responding tumors, and a high mutational load associated with improved survival. Innately resistant tumors displayed frequent transcriptomic up-expression of genes that enriched for mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, ECM organization, wound-healing and angiogenesis. The transcriptomes of innate resistance also enriched for signatures indicating up-regulation of these processes. Notably, MAPK-targeted therapy (MAPKi) induced similar signatures in melanoma, suggesting that a form of MAPKi resistance mediates cross-resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Co-enrichment of IPRIM (Innate anti-PD-1 Resistance Induced by MAPKi) signatures defined a transcriptomic subset across advanced cancers, suggesting that attenuating processes underlying these signatures may augment anti-PD1 responses.

Comparison of the HCC cell lines and primary HCCs demonstrated that, during long-term in vitro culture, cell lines retain the genetic landscape of the matched primary HCCs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78236GSE78275	Oxidative stress related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit a poor interspecies conservation and often show spatial- and temporal-specific expression patterns. What, if any, role they have in oxidative stress remains unknown. To identify potential roles for lncRNAs, we examined their expression in normal and H2O2-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Oxidative stress related lncRNAs were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500 platform. Sequencing of the cDNA libraries from H2O2-treated HUVECs generated 12.5 million uniquely valid reads, meanwhile, 10.2 million valid fragments were obtained from control group in our experiment. A total of 10, 765 known and 30, 629 novel putative lncRNAs were identified according to RNA-Seq. Among them, 2, 091 of known and 25, 800 of novel lncRNAs were differentially expressed in H2O2-treated HUVECs compared with control HUVECs, and 12 of these were validated with qRTPCR. Taken together, our findings provide evidence differentially expressed lncRNAs were mediated by oxidative stress in HUVECs, it is, therefore, likely that aberrant expression of lncRNAs, at least in part, participate in the process of endothelial injury caused by oxidative stress."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78275GSE78276	Activin A regulates human T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation	"To determine the role of the cytokine activin A in the regulation of human T follicular helper (Tfh) cell gene program, we performed a transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) of human nave CD4 T cells differentiated in vitro with activin A. The analysis of the gene expression profile driven by activin A, alone or in combination with IL-12 (a know regulator of human Tfh differentiation/function), revealed that activin A can regulate the expression of multiple molecules involved in the differentiation and/or function of human Tfh cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78276GSE78285	Modeling the ESR1 tyrosine 537 mutation with CRISPR-Cas9 for mechanistic studies and evaluation of therapeutic approaches for metastatic breast cancer [RNA-Seq]	"Estrogen receptor- (ER) is an important driver of breast cancer and is the target for hormonal therapies, anti-estrogens and drugs that limit estrogen biosynthesis (aromatase inhibitors). Mutations in the ESR1 gene identified in metastatic breast cancer provide a potential mechanism for acquired resistance to hormone therapies. We have used CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, generating MCF-7-Y537S. MCF-7-Y537S cells encode a wild-type (tyrosine 537) and a mutant (serine 537) allele. Growth of the line is estrogen-independent and expression of ER target genes is elevated in the absence of estrogen. ER ChIP-seq was carried out to map global ER binding sites in the presence and absence of estrogen. RNA-seq following estrogen treatment was used for gene expression analysis. We show that expression of ER target genes and ER recruitment to ER binding regions is similar in MCF-7 and MCF-7-Y537S cells, except that ER recruitment to DNA and expression of ER target genes is frequently elevated in the absence of estrogen."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78285GSE78288	small RNA-seq from GM12878 (ENCSR000AEJ)	"The libraries contained in this experiment come from independent growths of cell line GM12878.

A faulty differentiation arrest in this process leads to transformation and initiation of a Wilms' tumor. Mapping these transitions with respective surface markers affords accessibility to specific cell subpopulations. NCAM1 and CD133 have been previously suggested to mark human renal progenitor populations. Herein, using cell sorting, RNA sequencing, in vitro studies with serum-free media and in vivo xenotransplantation we demonstrate a sequential map that links human kidney development and tumorigenesis; In nephrogenesis, NCAM1+CD133- marks SIX2+ multipotent renal stem cells transiting to NCAM1+CD133+ differentiating segment-specific SIX2- epithelial progenitors and NCAM1-CD133+ differentiated nephron cells. In tumorigenesis, NCAM1+CD133- marks SIX2+ blastema that includes the ALDH1+ WT cancer stem/initiating cells, while NCAM1+CD133+ and NCAM1-CD133+ specifying early and late epithelial differentiation, are severely restricted in tumor initiation capacity and tumor self-renewal. Thus, negative selection for CD133 is required for defining NCAM1+ nephron stem cells in normal and malignant nephrogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78502GSE78506	24hr CA treatment vs. DMSO in HCT116 cells (from 'Identification of CDK8 and CDK19 substrates in human cells using cortistatin A and quantitative phosphoproteomics')	"Cortistatin A (CA) is a highly selective inhibitor of the Mediator kinases CDK8 and CDK19. Using CA, we report here the first large-scale identification of Mediator kinase substrates in human cells (HCT116). Among over 16,000 quantified phosphosites, we identified 78 high-confidence Mediator kinase targets within 64 proteins, including DNA-binding transcription factors and proteins associated with chromatin, DNA repair, and RNA polymerase II. Although RNA-Seq data correlated with Mediator kinase targets, CA effects on gene expression were limited and distinct from CDK8 or CDK19 knockdown. Quantitative proteome analyses, which tracked about 7,000 proteins across six time points (0  24h), revealed that CA selectively affected pathways implicated in inflammation, growth, and metabolic regulation; contrary to expectations, increased turnover of Mediator kinase targets was not generally observed. Collectively, these data support Mediator kinases as regulators of chromatin and RNA polymerase II activity and suggest cellular roles beyond transcription, including metabolism and DNA repair."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78506GSE78508	Enhanced CLIP uncovers IMP protein-RNA targets in human pluripotent stem cells important for cell adhesion and survival [RNA-Seq]	"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) require precise control of post-transcriptional RNA networks to maintain proliferation and survival. Using a recently developed enhanced UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) approach, we identify RNA targets of the IMP/IGF2BP family of RNA-binding proteins in hPSCs. At the broad region- and binding site-level IMP1 and IMP2 show reproducible binding to a large and overlapping set of 3'UTR-enriched targets. RNA Bind-N-Seq applied to recombinant full-length IMP1 and IMP2 reveals CA-rich motifs that are enriched in eCLIP-defined binding sites. We observe that IMP1 loss in hPSCs recapitulates IMP1 phenotypes, including a reduction in cell adhesion and an increase in cell death. For cell adhesion, in hPSCs we find IMP1 maintains levels of integrin mRNA, specifically regulating RNA stability of ITGB5. Additionally, we show IMP1 can be linked to hPSC survival via direct target BCL2. Thus, transcriptome-wide binding profiles identify hPSC targets modulating well-characterized IMP1 roles."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78508GSE78512	Identification Of Candidate Anti-Cancer Molecular Mechanisms Of Compound Kushen Injection Using Functional Genomics	"Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) has been clinically used in China for over 15 years to treat various types of solid tumours. However, because such Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) preparations are complex mixtures of plant secondary metabolites, it is essential to explore their underlying molecular mechanisms in a systematic fashion. We have used the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line as an initial in vitro model to identify CKI induced changes in gene expression. Cells were treated with CKI for 24 and 48 hours at two concentrations (1.0 and 2.0 mg/mL), and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was used to treat cells as a positive control. Cell proliferation and apoptosis activity were measured with XTT and Caspase-3 assays respectively. Transcriptome data of cells treated with CKI or 5-FU for 24 and 48 hours were acquired using high-throughput Illumina RNA-seq technology. In this report we show that CKI inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. We integrated and applied a series of transcriptome analysis methods, including gene differential expression analysis, pathway over-representation analysis, de novo identification of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) as well as co-expression network reconstruction, to identify candidate anti-cancer molecular mechanisms of CKI. Multiple pathways were perturbed and the cell cycle was identified as the potential primary target pathway of CKI in MCF-7 cells. CKI may also induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells via a p53 independent mechanism. In addition, we identified novel lncRNAs and showed that many of them might be expressed as a response to CKI treatment. Overall, we have comprehensively investigated the utility of transcriptome analysis with high-throughput sequencing to characterise the molecular response of cancer cells to a TCM drug, and provided a practical guideline for future molecular studies of TCM."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78512GSE78522	Next Generation Sequencing for Quantitative Analysis of transcriptome of follicular compared to non-follicular CD8 T cells from HIV+ Lymph nodes	"The goal of the study was to characterize the molecular signatures of CD8 T cell subpopulations sorted from HIV+ lymph nodes and HIV- tonsils. We compared the transcriptome profiles of follicular and non -foliccular CD8 T cells (sorted based on the surface expression fo CCR7 and CXCR5, chemokine receptors that govern the intratissue trafficking of T cells).

These programs of gene transcription have primarily been studied in mice, and it is not known if there are neuronal activity-regulated genes that control features of brain development and function that are unique to humans.

[RNA-Seq]	"Background. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with a dismal prognosis. It represents 15%% of pediatric ALL and has a threefold higher incidence among males. T-cell transformation is a multi-step process involving cooperating events leading to altered T-cell signaling, proliferation, differentiation and survival. Many recurrent alterations have been identified and help define molecular subgroups of T-ALL, however the full range of events involved in driving transformation remain to be defined. Results. Using an integrative approach combining genomic and transcriptomic data, we performed comprehensive molecular characterization of 30 pediatric T-ALLs. We identified common T-ALL targets and confirmed the overall poor outcome of early immature cases. We also showed that deletion of the CDKN2A locus is associated with lower risk of relapse. In addition, we identified novel T-ALL drivers including a member of the spliceosome machinery U2AF1 as well as novel X-linked tumor suppressors MED12 and USP9X, that had never been associated to T-ALL before. Interestingly, almost 60%% of these events were found in early immature cases which represented only 35%% of the cohort. Functional validations further demonstrated the putative role of these novel T-ALL genes in driving transformation by demonstrating the aberrant splicing provoked by U2AF1 p.R35L and the protective effect against apoptosis of MED12 and USP9X repression. Conclusions. This study highlights the underlying genomic complexity of pediatric T-ALL, and the need for larger integrative studies to decipher the mechanisms that contribute to its various subtypes and provide opportunities to refine patient stratification and treatment."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78785GSE78922	Enhanced T cell responses to IL-6 in type 1 diabetes are associated with early clinical disease and increased IL-6 receptor expression	IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in multiple autoimmune diseases. Here we show that IL-6 induced STAT3 and STAT1 phosphorylation is enhanced in CD4 and CD8 T cells from patients with T1D compared to healthy controls. Enhanced IL-6/pSTAT3 is associated with increased surface IL-6R and early clinical disease. The transcriptome of IL-6 treated CD4 T cells from T1D patients reveals upregulation of genes involved in T cell migration. The data suggest that individuals with type 1 diabetes may benefit from therapeutic targeting of the IL-6 pathway.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78922GSE78925	Differentially expressed vascular development genes for iPSC-ECs from CDI	"Here we report genes upregulated for iPSC-ECs cultured in PEG hydrogels relative to control cells on tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) surfaces included adhesion, matrix remodeling, and Notch signaling pathway genes relevant to in vivo vascular development."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78925GSE78936	Systematically characterizing dysfunctional long intergenic non-coding RNAs in multiple brain regions of major psychosis	"Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are severe neuropsychiatric disorders with serious impact on patients, together termed major psychosis. Recently, long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) were reported to play important roles in mental diseases. However, little was known about their molecular mechanism in pathogenesis of SZ and BD. Here, we performed RNA sequencing on 82 post-mortem brain tissues from three brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex (BA11), anterior cingulate cortex (BA24) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9)) of patients with SZ and BD and control subjects, generating over one billion reads. We characterized lincRNA transcriptome in the three brain regions and identified 20 differentially expressed lincRNAs (DELincRNAs) in BA11 for BD, 34 and 1 in BA24 and BA9 for SZ, respectively. Our results showed that these DELincRNAs exhibited brain region-specific patterns. Applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we revealed that DELincRNAs together with other genes can function as modules to perform different functions in different brain regions, such as immune system development in BA24 and oligodendrocyte differentiation in BA9. Additionally, we found that DNA methylation alteration could partly explain the dysregulation of lincRNAs, some of which could function as enhancers in the pathogenesis of major psychosis. Together, we performed systematical characterization of dysfunctional lincRNAs in multiple brain regions of major psychosis, which provided a valuable resource to understand their roles in SZ and BD pathology and helped to discover novel biomarkers."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78936GSE78959	Modeling the Neuropathology of Tuberous Sclerosis with Human Stem Cells Reveals a Role for Inflammation and Angiogenic Growth Factors [Cell Model]	"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disease characterized by mTOR hyperfunction induced benign tumor growths in multiple organs and neurological symptoms. Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead.

Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Accordingly, transcriptome analysis uncovered an inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, while ribosome profiling revealed excessive translation of ribosomal transcripts and higher synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors.

KSHV encodes for a number of microRNAs (miRNAs), and KSHV infection can affect the expression of cellular miRNAs. Hypoxia has been shown to induce KSHV reactivation, directly induce several KSHV lytic genes, and also induce the most abundant latent viral protein, LANA. Also, several KSHV proteins can stabilize and increase the cellular levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1). However, the degree to which hypoxic pathways are utilized by KSHV has yet to be determined. Methods: We investigated the interplay between hypoxia and KSHV infection by comparing the 31effects of hypoxia and KSHV infection on miRNA and mRNA expression, and by examining the 32effects of hypoxia on uninfected and KSHV-infected cells. This was accomplished using next-33generation sequencing (NGS), qRT-PCR, Taqman assays, and pathway analysis. Results: NGS analysis of human mRNAs revealed striking similarities (~34%%) between the transcriptomic response to hypoxia and the transcriptomic response to KSHV infection. Additionally, hsa-miR-210, a key hypoxia-inducible miRNA with pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic properties, was found significantly up-regulated by both KSHV infection and hypoxia using Taqman assays. Finally, KSHV infected cells differed somewhat in their response to hypoxia compared to KSHV-uninfected controls. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that KSHV harnesses a part of the hypoxic cellular response and induces miR-210 up-regulation. The understanding of how these miRNAs, genes and pathways are regulated by HIF-1 and KSHV infection are essential to a better understanding of the biology of KSHV-associated diseases."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79029GSE79147	IGF2BP3 controls cancer cell invasiveness by modulation RISC function	The goal of this study was to determine IGF2BP3 regulation of RNA targets in human pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79147GSE79160	RNA-seq analysis of control and podoplanin knockdown lymphatic endothelial cells	To determine the transcriptome changes after podoplanin was knocked down in human lymphatic endothelial cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79160GSE79183	Changes in RNA expression in human oral cavity carcinoma cells as a result of LDB1 reduction	The study was designed to identify differential expressed genes between human oral cavity carcinoma cell lines with and without LDBI knockout	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79183GSE79272	Stimulation of isolated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with TLR9 agonist CpG C (CpG) and TLR7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ)	The purpose of this experiment was to assess the genes upregulated when pDCs were stimulated with TLR7 agonist imiquimod and TLR9 agonist CpG C.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79272GSE79284	Sensitivity and engineered resistance of myeloid leukemia cells to BRD9 inhibition (RNA-seq)	"Our study shows that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells require the BRD9 subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to sustain MYC transcription, rapid cell proliferation, and a block in differentiation. Based on these observations, we derived small-molecule inhibitors of the BRD9 bromodomain, which selectively suppressed the proliferation of mouse and human AML cell lines. To establish these effects as on-target, we engineered a bromodomain-swap allele of BRD9, which retains functionality despite a radically altered bromodomain pocket. Expression of this allele in AML cells conferred resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of our compound series, thus establishing BRD9 as the relevant cellular target. Furthermore, we used an analogous domain-swap strategy to generate an inhibitor-resistant allele of EZH2. Our study provides the first evidence for a role of BRD9 in cancer and reveals a simple genetic strategy for constructing resistance alleles to demonstrate on-target activity of chemical probes in cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79284GSE79293	Global transcript structure resolution of high gene density genomes through multi-platform data integration: deepCAGE	deepCAGE was used in conjunction with Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq to globally resolve transcript structures in replicating Epstein-Barr virus.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79293GSE79301	Strand-oriented RNAseq of LNCaP prostate cancer cells in culture for 48 h in the absence of androgen	"The goal of this study was to use NGS RNAseq deep-sequencing in order to characterize the complement of polyadenylated mRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in LNCaP, a prostate cancer cell line.

Here, we describe the generation of functional human oocytes following nuclear transfer of first polar body (PB1) genomes from metaphase II (MII) oocytes into enucleated donor MII cytoplasm (PBNT). The reconstructed oocytes supported the formation of de novo meiotic spindles and, after fertilization with sperm, meiosis completion and formation of normal diploid zygotes. While PBNT zygotes developed to blastocysts less frequently (42%%) than controls (75%%), genome-wide genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional analyses of PBNT and control ESCs indicated comparable numbers of structural variations and markedly similar DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles. We conclude that rescue of PB1 genetic material via introduction into donor cytoplasm may offer a source of oocytes for infertility treatment or mitochondrial replacement therapy for mtDNA disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79309GSE79338	The Glioma-Infiltrating T Cell Receptor Repertoire	"While immune signaling has emerged as a defining feature of the glioma microenvironment, local selection of responding T cells and their anti-tumor potential as a population are difficult to measure directly in patients. High-throughput sequencing of T cell receptor repertoires (TCRseq) provides a population-wide statistical description of how T cells respond to disease. Here, we define new immunophenotypes in glioma based on TCRseq and RNA-Seq of tumor tissue, non-neoplastic brain tissue, and peripheral blood from patients. Using information theory, we characterize antigen-driven selection in glioma and its relationship with the expression of distinct immune-functional pathways in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we identify a strong relationship between usage of certain TCR in peripheral blood and the divergence of the infiltrating T cell population from the peripheral repertoire. We anticipate that these immunophenotypes will be foundational to monitoring and predicting response to anti-glioma vaccines and immunotherapy."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79338GSE79343	RNA-seq analysis of growth factor response of NHEKs to antimicrobial petide LL-37 and dsRNA mimic Poly(I:C)	"In this study, we analyzed how non-coding double stranded RNA (dsRNAs) act as a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in the skin, and how the human cathelicidin AMP LL-37 might influence growth factor production in response to this DAMP."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79343GSE79362	A blood RNA signature for tuberculosis disease risk: a prospective cohort study	"Identification of blood biomarkers that prospectively predict progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease might lead to interventions that combat the tuberculosis epidemic. We aimed to assess whether global gene expression measured in whole blood of healthy people allowed identification of prospective signatures of risk of active tuberculosis disease. RESULTS:Between July 6, 2005, and April 23, 2007, we enrolled 6363 from the ACS study and 4466 from independent South African and Gambian cohorts. 46 progressors and 107 matched controls were identified in the ACS cohort. A 16 gene signature of risk was identified. The signature predicted tuberculosis progression with a sensitivity of 661%% (95%% CI 632689) and a specificity of 806%% (792820) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis diagnosis. The risk signature was validated in an untouched group of adolescents (p=0018 for RNA sequencing and p=00095 for qRT-PCR) and in the independent South African and Gambian cohorts (p values <00001 by qRT-PCR) with a sensitivity of 537%% (426643) and a specificity of 828%% (76786) in 12 months preceding tuberculosis.

A frequent concomitant event is the loss of the residual ETV6 allele suggesting a critical role for the ETV6 transcriptional repressor in the etiology of pre-B ALL. However, the precise mechanism through which loss of functional ETV6 contributes to disease pathogenesis is still unclear Results: To investigate the impact of ETV6 loss on the transcriptional network and identify new transcriptional targets of ETV6, we used whole transcriptome analysis of both pre-B leukemic cell lines and pre-B ALL patients combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation. Using this integrative approach, we identified 4 novel direct ETV6 target genes: CLIC5, BIRC7, ANGPTL2 and WBP1L. To further evaluate the role of chloride intracellular channel protein CLIC5 in leukemogenesis, we generated cell lines overexpressing CLIC5 and demonstrated an increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. We further described the implications of CLIC5s ion channel activity in lysosomal-mediated cell death, possibly by modulating the function of transferrin receptor with which it co-localizes intracellularly. Conclusion: For the first time, we showed that loss of ETV6 leads to significant overexpression of CLIC5, which in turn leads to decreased lysosome-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggest that heightened CLIC5 activity could promote a permissive environment for oxidative-stress induced DNA damage accumulation and thereby contribute to leukemogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79373GSE79400	"Digitalis-like compounds facilitate redifferentiation of non-medullary thyroid cancer through intracellular Ca2+, cFOS and autophagy dependent pathways"	"About 20-30%% of patients with metastatic non-medullary thyroid cancer (TC) have persistent or recurrent disease resulting from tumor dedifferentiation. Tumor redifferentiation to restore sensitivity to radioactive iodine therapy is considered a promising strategy to overcome RAI resistance. Autophagy has emerged as an important mechanism in cancer dedifferentiation. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of autophagy activation for redifferentiation in thyroid cancer cell lines. Five, all digitalis-like compounds, restored hNIS expression and iodine uptake in TC cell lines. Upregulation of hNIS was mediated by intracellular Ca2+ and cFOS activation. Cell proliferation was inhibited by downregulating Akt1 and by induction of autophagy and p21-dependent cell cycle arrest.

To determine the functional effect of each site, we measured the glucocorticoid (GC) responsive activity of nearly all GR binding sites (GBSs) captured using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in A549 cells. 13%% of GBSs assayed had GC-induced activity. The responsive sites were defined by direct GR binding via a GC response element (GRE) and exclusively increased reporter- gene expression. Meanwhile, most GBSs lacked GC-induced reporter activity. The non-responsive sites had epigenetic features of steady state enhancers and clustered around direct GBSs. Together, our data support a model in which clusters of GBSs observed with ChIP-seq reflect interactions between direct and tethered GBSs over tens of kilobases. We further show that those interactions can synergistically modulate the activity of direct GBSs, and may therefore play a major role in driving gene activation in response to GCs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79426GSE79470	Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of human embryonic stem cells derived MESP1-mTomato reporter cells	"Purpose: To compare the transcriptome of MESP1-mTomato reporter cells at undifferentiated state, mesoderm differentiation day 3 mTomato+ and mTomato- cells and MESP1+ cells undergoing endothelial differentiation in 2D and 3D.

In the case of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the mTOR complex (mTORC1) mediates IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-induced estrogen receptor alpha (ER) phosphorylation/activation and leads to increased proliferation and growth in breast cancer cells. As a result, the prevalence of mTOR inhibitors combined with hormonal therapy has increased in recent years. Conversely, activated mTORC1 provides negative feedback regulation of IGF signaling via insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 serine phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, the IGF pathway may provide escape (e.g. de novo or acquired resistance) from mTORC1 inhibitors. It is therefore plausible that combined inhibition of mTORC1 and IGF-1R for select subsets of ER-positive breast cancer patients presents as a viable therapeutic option. Methods: Using hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (MCF-7/AC-1), works presented herein describe the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of the following compounds: dalotuzumab (DALO; MK-0646; anti-IGF-1R antibody), ridaforolimus (RIDA; MK-8669; mTORC1 small molecule inhibitor) and letrozole (LET, aromatase inhibitor). Results: With the exception of MK-0646, all single agent and combination treatment arms effectively inhibited xenograft tumor growth, albeit to varying degrees. Correlative tissue analyses revealed MK-0646 alone and in combination with LET induced insulin receptor alpha A (InsR-A) isoform upregulation (both mRNA and protein expression), thereby further supporting a triple therapy approach. Conclusion: These data provide preclinical rationalization towards the combined triple therapy of LET plus MK-0646 plus MK-8669 as an efficacious anti-tumor strategy for ER-positive breast tumors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79492GSE79552	The transcriptome and chromatin accessbility landscape of mammalian germline	"We first isolate the PGCs from the Oct4-Gfp knock-in mice, and KIT-positive PGCs from the post-implantation human fetus.

However, recent studies have challenged this view, showing that poly(A) tail length and translation efficiency are decoupled in non-embryonic cells. Using TAIL-seq and ribosome profiling, we investigate poly(A) tail dynamics and translational control in the somatic cell cycle. We find dramatic changes in poly(A) tail lengths of cell cycle regulatory genes like CDK1, TOP2A, and FBXO5, explaining their translational repression in M phase. We also find that poly(A) tail length is coupled to translation when the poly(A) tail is <20 nucleotides. However, as most genes have >20 nucleotide poly(A) tails, their translation is regulated mainly via poly(A) tail length-independent mechanisms during the cell cycle. Specifically, we find that terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) tract-containing transcripts escape global translational suppression in M phase and are actively translated. Our quantitative and comprehensive data provide a revised view of translational control in the somatic cell cycle."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79664GSE79666	Transcriptome sequencing reveals aberrant alternative splicing in Huntington's disease	"Huntingtons disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG expansion in the gene encoding Huntingtin (HTT). Transcriptome dysregulation is a major feature of HD pathogenesis, as revealed by a large body of work on gene expression profiling of tissues from human HD patients and mouse models. These studies were primarily focused on transcriptional changes affecting steady-state overall gene expression levels using microarray based approaches. A major missing component however has been the study of transcriptome changes at the post-transcriptional level, such as alternative splicing. Alternative splicing is a critical mechanism for expanding regulatory and functional diversity from a limited number of genes, and is particularly complex in the mammalian brain. Here we carried out a deep RNA-seq analysis of 7 human HD brains and 7 controls to systematically discover aberrant alternative splicing events and characterize potential associated splicing factors in HD. We identified 593 differential alternative splicing events between HD and control brains. Using an expanded panel of 54 brain tissues from patients and controls, we also identified 9 splicing factors exhibiting significantly altered expression levels in HD patient brains. Moreover, follow-up molecular analyses of one splicing factor PTBP1 revealed its impact on disease-associated splicing patterns in HD.

Notch signaling has been a molecular target in BTICs, but Notch antagonists have demonstrated limited efficacy in clinical trials. RBPJ is considered a central transcriptional mediator of Notch activity. Here, we report that pharmacologic Notch inhibitors were less effective than targeting RBPJ in suppressing tumor growth. While Notch inhibitors decreased canonical Notch gene expression, RBPJ regulated a distinct profile of genes critical to BTIC stemness and cell cycle progression. RBPJ was preferentially expressed by BTICs and required for BTIC self-renewal and tumor growth. MYC, a key BTIC regulator, bound the RBPJ promoter and treatment with a BET family bromodomain inhibitor decreased MYC and RBPJ expression. Proteomic studies demonstrated that RBPJ binds CDK9, a component of P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor), to target gene promoters, enhancing transcriptional elongation. Collectively, RBPJ links MYC and transcriptional control through CDK9, providing potential nodes of fragility for therapeutic intervention, potentially distinct from Notch."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79735GSE79779	Transcriptional profiling of JEG3 cells with HLA-G ablation via deletion of Enhancer L	"HLA-G is a nonclassical HLA molecule expressed specifically in the placenta. While it is known to play a central role in maternal immune tolerance during pregnancy, the mechanism underlying its tissue-specific expression remains poorly understood. To elucidate this mechanism, we used a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) to systematically interrogate the HLA-G locus. This uncovered Enhancer L, a novel cis-regulatory element with enhancer activity 12kb upstream of HLA-G. To verify enhancer function and specificity for HLA-G in culture, we deleted Enhancer L in JEG3 cells and performed RNA sequencing and differential expression analysis. Upon Enhancer L knockout, we observe complete ablation of HLA-G and minimal dysregulation of other genes within 2Mb, suggesting that HLA-G is the only direct cis target of Enhancer L. DNase-seq and Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) confirm that Enhancer L is a cell type-specific enhancer that loops into the HLA-G promoter. MPRA-based saturation mutagenesis of Enhancer L identifies motifs for transcription factors of the CEBP and GATA families which are essential for placentation. These factors associate with Enhancer L and regulate HLA-G expression. Our findings identify long-range chromatin looping mediated by core trophoblast transcription factors as a novel mechanism controlling tissue-specific HLA-G expression at the maternal-fetal interface."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79779GSE79782	Amnion as a surrogate tissue reporter of the effects of maternal preeclampsia on the fetus [RNA-Seq]	"Background: Preeclampsia, traditionally characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria, is a common pregnancy complication, which affects 2-8%% of all pregnancies. Although children born to women with preeclampsia have a higher risk of hypertension in later life, the mechanism of this increased risk is unknown. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that has been studied as a mediator of cellular memory of adverse exposures in utero. Since each cell type in the body has a unique DNA profile, cell subtype composition is a major confounding factor in studies of tissues with heterogeneous cell types. The best way to avoid this confounding effect is by using purified cell types. However, the use purified cell types in large cohort translational studies is difficult. The amnion, the inner layer of the fetal membranes of placenta, is derived from the epiblast and consists of two cell types, which are easy to isolate from the delivered placenta. In this study, we demonstrate the value of using amnion samples for DNA methylation studies, revealing distinctive patterns between fetuses exposed to preeclampsia or hypertension and fetuses from normal pregnancies. Results: We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, HELP-tagging, on 62 amnion samples from placentas of uncomplicated, normal pregnancies, and those with complications of preeclampsia or hypertension. Using a regression model approach, we found 123, 85 and 99 loci with high confidence hypertension-associated, proteinuria-associated and hypertension and proteinuria-associated DNA methylation changes, respectively. We also found that these differentially methylated regions overlap loci previously reported as differentially methylated regions in preeclampsia. Conclusions: Our findings support prior observations that preeclampsia is associated with changes of DNA methylation near genes that have previously been found to be dysregulated in preeclampsia. We propose that amnionic membranes represent a valuable surrogate fetal tissue on which to perform epigenome-wide association studies of adverse intrauterine conditions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79782GSE79842	RNAseq from disomic and trisomic fibroblasts and lymphoblastoids	RNA was sequenced from individuals Disomic and Trisomic for chromosome 21 to identify consistent changes in gene expression across individuals	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79842GSE79859	RNA expression analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines treated with epigenetic drugs	"The impact of drugs inhibiting DNA methylation (5-aza-2'-deoxycytodine, DAC) and EZH2 (EPZ-6438) on the neuroblastoma transcriptome was analyzed in two neuroblastoma cell lines.

The up-regulated genes are highly enriched for both predicted miR-30 targets as well as genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Inhibition of miR-30 also led to significantly reduced IEC proliferation and an increase in markers of enterocyte differentiation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79923GSE79955	THZ1 targeting CDK7 suppresses STAT transcriptional activity and sensitizes T-cell lymphomas to BCL2 inhibitors	"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are aggressive diseases with poor response to chemotherapy and dismal survival. Identification of effective strategies to target PTCL biology represents an urgent need. Here we report that PTCL are sensitive to transcription-targeting drugs, and, in particular, to THZ1, a covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7). The STAT-signaling pathway is highly vulnerable to THZ1 even in PTCL cells that carry the activating STAT3 mutation Y640F. In mutant cells, CDK7 inhibition decreases STAT3 chromatin binding and expression of highly transcribed target genes like MYC, PIM1, MCL1, CD30, IL2RA, CDC25A and IL4R. In surviving cells, THZ1 decreases the expression of STAT-regulated anti-apoptotic BH3 family members MCL1 and BCL-XL sensitizing PTCL cells to BH3 mimetic drugs. Accordingly, the combination of THZ1 and the BH3 mimetic obatoclax improves lymphoma growth control in a primary PTCL ex vivo culture and in two STAT3-mutant PTCL xenografts, delineating a potential targeted agent-based therapeutic option for these patients."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79955GSE79968	Merkel cell polyomavirus small T antigen promotes pro-glycolytic metabolic perturbations required for transformation	"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is an etiological agent of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a highly aggressive skin cancer. The MCPyV small tumor antigen (ST) is required for maintenance of MCC and can transform normal cells. To gain insight into cellular perturbations induced by MCPyV ST, we performed transcriptome analysis of normal human fibroblasts with inducible expression of ST. MCPyV ST dynamically alters the cellular transcriptome with increased levels of glycolytic genes, including the monocarboxylate lactate transporter SLC16A1 (MCT1). Extracellular flux analysis revealed increased lactate export reflecting elevated aerobic glycolysis in ST expressing cells. Inhibition of MCT1 activity suppressed the growth of MCC cell lines and impaired MCPyV-dependent transformation of IMR90 cells. Both NF-B and MYC have been shown to regulate MCT1 expression. While MYC was required for MCT1 induction, MCPyV-induced MCT1 levels decreased following knockdown of the NF-B subunit RelA, supporting a synergistic activity between MCPyV and MYC in regulating MCT1 levels. Several MCC lines had high levels of MYCL and MYCN but not MYC. Increased levels of MYCL was more effective than MYC or MYCN in increasing extracellular acidification in MCC cells. Our results demonstrate the effects of MCPyV ST on the cellular transcriptome and reveal that transformation is dependent, at least in part, on elevated aerobic glycolysis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79968GSE79970	Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) Gene Expression-Based Biomarkers in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)	Aim: To discovery biomarkers in JIA base on gene expression from RNA sequencing on PBMC Method: Paired-end Ilumina sequencing to capture gene expression of PBMC from JIA individuals and healthy controls Results:sample heterogeneity makes RNA sequencing on PBMC unsuitable as a first-step method for screening biomarker candidates in JIA	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79970GSE80043	"Chromatin environment, transcriptional regulation and splicing distinguish lncRNAs and mRNAs [NucFrac]"	"While long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs share similar biogenesis pathways, these two transcript classes differ in many regards.

The seed sequence of miRNAs is the key determinant to recognize the target sites. The paralogous miRNAs, which share the same seed sequences but differ in their 3 parts, are known to regulate largely overlapping group of miRNAs. However, there is still no study which analyzes the functional difference among paralogous miRNAs. In this study, we compared the function between paralogous miRNAs, miR-221 and miR-222. By employing nuclease-mediated genome engineering technique, we established the knockout cell lines for these miRNAs, and analyzed their difference in target regulation precisely. We found that miR-221 and miR-222 suppress the previously identified targets, CDKN1B and CDKN1C, differentially. From the transcriptome analyses, we also found that large number of different transcripts with independent functions respond exclusively only to each of miR-221 and miR-222, respectively. Therefore, the miRNAs with common seed sequences can exert dissimilar function by regulating different groups of target mRNAs. This study illustrates that more researches are required to establish the rules of target site recognition by miRNAs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80064GSE80072	Joint-specific DNA transcriptome signatures in rheumatoid arthritis [RNA-seq]	"Stratifying patients on the basis of molecular signatures could facilitate development of therapeutics that target pathways specific to a particular disease or tissue location. Previous studies suggest that pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is similar in all affected joints. Here we show that distinct DNA methylation and transcriptome signatures not only discriminate RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from osteoarthritis FLS, but also distinguish RA FLS isolated from knees and hips. Using genome-wide methods, we show differences between RA knee and hip FLS in the methylation of genes encoding biological pathways, such as IL-6 signaling via JAK-STAT pathway. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes are identified between knee and hip FLS using RNA-seq. Double-evidenced genes that are both differentially methylated and expressed include multiple HOX genes. Joint-specific DNA signatures suggest that RA disease mechanisms might vary from joint to joint, thus potentially explaining some of the diversity of drug responses in RA patients."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80072GSE80073	Generation of Brain Region-specific Organoids using a Miniaturized Spinning Bioreactor and Modelling ZIKV Exposure	"Cerebral organoids, three-dimensional cultures that model organogenesis, provide a new platform to investigate human brain development. High cost, variability and tissue heterogeneity limit accessibility and broad applications of current organoid technologies. Here we developed a miniaturized spinning bioreactor (Spin) to generate forebrain-specific organoids from human iPSCs. These organoids recapitulate key features of human cortical development, including progenitor zone organization, neurogenesis, gene expression, and importantly, a distinct human-specific outer radial glia cell layer. We have also developed protocols to generate midbrain and hypothalamic organoids. Finally, we employed this forebrain organoid platform to model Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. Quantitative analyses revealed that preferential, productive ZIKA infection of cortical neural progenitors leads to increased cell death and reduced proliferation, resulting in decreased neuronal cell layer volume that resembles microcephaly. Together, our brain region-specific organoids and Spin provide an accessible and versatile platform for modeling human brain development and diseases, and for compound testing."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80073GSE80082	Integrin signaling regulates YAP/TAZ to control skin homeostasis	"The skin is a squamous epithelium that is continuously renewed by a population of basal layer stem/progenitor cells and can heal wounds. Here, we show that the transcription regulators YAP and TAZ localise to the nucleus in the basal layer of skin and are elevated upon wound healing. Skin-specific deletion of both YAP and TAZ in adult mice slows proliferation of basal layer cells, leads to hair loss and impairs regeneration after wounding. Contact with the basal extracellular matrix and consequent integrin-Src signalling is a key determinant of the nuclear localisation of YAP/TAZ in basal layer cells and in skin tumours. Contact with the basement membrane is lost in differentiating daughter cells, where YAP and TAZ become mostly cytoplasmic. In other types of squamous epithelia and squamous cell carcinomas, a similar control mechanism is present. By contrast, columnar epithelia differentiate an apical domain that recruits CRB3, Merlin (also known as NF2), KIBRA (also known as WWC1) and SAV1 to induce Hippo signalling and retain YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm despite contact with the basal layer extracellular matrix. When columnar epithelial tumours lose their apical domain and become invasive, YAP/TAZ becomes nuclear and tumour growth becomes sensitive to the Src inhibitor Dasatinib."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80082GSE80095	Transcriptome Profiling of Human Primary Monocytes	"We profiled the gene expression pattern of human primary monocyte, an essential component of the innate immune system, from healthy subjects using RNA-Seq analysis"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80095GSE80098	Genomic agonism and phenotypic antagonism between estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast cancer.

Such methods can cause loss of coverage at the 5 end of genes, impacting the ability to detect fusions when used on degraded samples. The goal of this study was to quantify the effects RNA degradation has on fusion detection when using poly-A selected mRNA and to identify the variables involved in this process Methods: Total RNA was extracted from solid tumor tissue and whole blood using the Qiagen miRNeasy Micro and Mini kits, respectively. The KU812 cell line was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and UHR (Universal Human Reference RNA) was purchased from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA). UHR is a mixture of cell lines derived from breast adenocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma, cervix adenocarcinoma, testis embryonal carcinoma, gliobastoma, melanoma, liposarcoma, histiocytic lymphoma, lymphoblastic leukemia and plasmocytoma. For Degradation experiments, two micrograms of human universal reference RNA (UHR) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and 1ug of RNA extracted from KU812 cell line (purchased from ATCC) were degraded at 74oC from 1 to 11 minutes in 1 minute intervals, using the NEBNext Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module Kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA). RNA was then purified and concentrated with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Results: In this study, we designed experiments using artificially degraded RNA from cell lines as well as naturally degraded RNA from tissue samples to quantify the effect RNA degradation has on fusion detection when using poly-A selected RNA libraries We found that both the RNA degradation level and the distance from the 3 end of a gene, negatively impact the read coverage profile in RNA-seq. Furthermore, the median transcript coverage decreases exponentially as a function of the distance from the 3 end and there is a linear relationship between the coverage decay rate and the RNA integrity number (RIN). Conclusions: we found that when using poly-A pulldown techniques for library preparation in RNA-seq, the fusion sensitivity is negatively impacted by both sample degradation and distance of the fusion breakpoint from the 3 end and developed graphs that show such effect.

Deregulated expression of these genes is linked to the initiation and progression of numerous diseases associated with exacerbated inflammation. Here, we identify Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) as a critical positive regulator of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional activity at pathogen-induced genes. Notably, depletion or chemical inhibition of Top1 suppresses the host response against replicating Influenza and Ebola viruses as well as bacterial products. As a result, therapeutic pharmacological inhibition of Top1 protects mice from death in experimental models of chemical- and pathogen-induced lethal inflammation.

The most frequent U2AF1 mutant, U2AF1 p.Ser34Phe (S34F), induces specific changes in pre-mRNA splicing, but it is unclear how these splicing changes are regulated. We have used genomic editing methods to modify the U2AF1 gene locus in an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3kt) and in human lung adenocarcinoma cells with pre-existing U2AF1 alleles, creating a U2AF1 S34F allele in the endogenous locus of HBEC3kts and inactivating U2AF1 S34F alleles in two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (H441 and HCC78). By comparing global splicing alterations in these isogenic pairs of cell lines, we have identified many splicing alterations that are associated with the U2AF1 S34F mutation. Further, by decreasing the levels of wild-type U2AF1 in the isogenic HBEC3kt cells, we show that the magnitude of mutant-associated splicing is proportional to the ratio of S34F:WT gene products. This observation suggest that wild-type U2AF1 is a negative regulator of splicing alterations induced by U2AF1 S34F."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80136GSE80137	HLA peptides derived from tumor antigens induced by inhibition of DNA methylation for development of drug-facilitated immunotherapy	"Treatment of cancer cells with anti-cancer drugs often fails to achieve complete remission. Yet, such drug treatments may induce alteration in the tumors gene expression patterns, including those of Cancer/Testis Antigens (CTA). The degradation products of such antigens can be presented as HLA peptides on the surface of the tumor cells and be developed into anti-cancer immunotherapeutics. For example, the DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Decitabine) has limited anti-tumor efficacy, yet it induces the expression of many genes, including CTAs that are normally silenced in the healthy adult tissues. In this study, the presentation of many new HLA peptides derived from CTAs and induced by Decitabine was demonstrated in three human Glioblastoma cell lines. Such presentation of CTA-derived HLA peptides can be exploited for development of new treatment modalities, combining drug treatment with anti-CTA targeted immunotherapy. The Decitabine-induced HLA peptidomes include many CTAs that are not normally detected in healthy tissues or in cancer cells, unless treated with the drug. In addition, the study included large-scale analyses of the simultaneous effects of Decitabine on the transcriptomes, proteomes and HLA peptidomes of the human Glioblastoma cells.

However, the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes has not been studied extensively owing to the lack of sufficient information about the promoters and transcription start sites of most miRNAs. Results: In this study, we identified the transcription start sites of human primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) using DROSHA knockout cells. DROSHA knockout resulted in increased accumulation of pri-miRNAs and facilitated the precise mapping of their 5 end nucleotides using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. By analyzing the promoter region encompassing the transcription start sites of miRNAs, we found that the unrelated miRNAs in their sequences have many common elements in their promoters for binding the same transcription factors. Moreover, by analyzing intronic miRNAs, we also obtained comprehensive evidence that miRNA-harboring introns are spliced more slowly than other introns.

Yet the role of BCL6 in maintaining these lymphomas has not been investigated. BCL6 mediates its effects by recruiting corepressors to an extended groove motif. Development of effective BCL6 inhibitors requires compounds exceeding the binding affinity of these corepressors. Objectives: To design small molecule inhibitors with superior potency vs. endogenous BCL6 ligands for unmet putative therapeutic needs such as targeting ABC-DLBCL. Findings: We used an in silico drug design functional-group mapping approach called SILCS to create a specific BCL6 inhibitor with 10-fold greater potency than endogenous corepressors. The compound, called FX1, binds in such a way as to occupy an essential region of the BCL6 lateral groove. FX1 disrupts BCL6 repression complex formation, reactivates BCL6 target genes, and mimics the phenotype of mice engineered to express BCL6 with lateral groove mutations. This compound eradicated established DLBCLs xenografts at low doses. Most strikingly, FX1 suppressed ABC-DLBCL cells as well as primary human ABC-DLBCL specimens ex vivo. Conclusions: ABC-DLBCL is a BCL6 dependent disease that can be targeted by novel inhibitors able to exceed the binding affinity of natural BCL6 ligands."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80351GSE80397	Global transcriptome analysis in the MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line IMR5-75 upon inducible MYCN-knockdown	"Inducible MYCN-knockdown, followed by RNA-seq analysis in the MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line IMR5-75, reveals profound time-dependent transcriptome changes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80397GSE80434	Molecular Signatures Associated with ZIKV Exposure in Human Cortical Neural Progenitors	"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes microcephaly and has been linked to other brain abnormalities.

Results: we establish the quantitative portrait of the UGT transcriptome in major metabolic organs and characterize cellular functions of selected alternative UGT isoforms with novel in-frame sequences. Targeted RNA sequencing uncovered that AS significantly shapes the UGT transcriptome, with variants quantitatively representing up to 35%% and 60%% UGT transcripts in normal and tumoral tissues respectively.

Single-cell analysis tools such as FACS, FISH-FC and single-cell barcode-based sequencing can investigate cellular heterogeneity; however, they have significant limitations that impede their ability to identify and transcriptionally characterize many rare cell subpopulations. Results: PCR-activated cell sorting (PACS) is a novel cytometry method that uses single-cell TaqMan PCR reactions performed in microfluidic droplets to identify and isolate cell subtypes with high-throughput. Here, we extend this method and demonstrate that PACS enables high-dimensional molecular profiling on TaqMan-targeted cells. Using a random priming RNA-Seq strategy, we obtained high-fidelity transcriptome measurements following PACS-sorting of prostate cancer cells from a heterogeneous population. The sequencing data revealed prostate cancer gene expression profiles that were obscured in the unsorted populations. Single-cell expression analysis with PACS was subsequently used to confirm a number of the differentially expressed genes identified with RNA sequencing. Conclusions: PACS requires minimal sample processing, uses readily available TaqMan assays and can isolate cell subtypes with high sensitivity. We have now validated a method for performing next-generation sequencing on mRNA obtained from PACS isolated cells. This capability makes PACS well suited for transcriptional profiling of rare cells from complex populations to obtain maximal biological insight into cell states and behaviors."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80551GSE80563	FBXO10 deficiency and BTK activation upregulate BCL2 expression in mantle cell lymphoma	"Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways.

Altered expression of 6 genes was then confirmed with qRTPCR, demonstrating the high qulity of the RNA-seq method."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80563GSE80611	Comparative Analysis of Cas9 Activators Across Multiple Species	RNA-Seq after Cas9-gRNA transfection with different activators targeting HBG1	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80611GSE80651	RNA sequencing analysis of human podocytes reveals glucocorticoid regulated gene networks targeting non-immune pathways	"To understand the nature of glucocorticoids targeting non-immune cell function, we generate RNA sequencing data from 3 human podocyte cell lines derived from 3 kidney transplant donors and identify the genes that are significantly regulated in dexamethasone-treated podocytes compared to vehicle-treated cells.Our results represent a significant step forward in the genome-wide characterization of the molecular effects of glucocorticoids on human podocytes. The resource generated in this study is important for understanding the targeting of non-immune cell function by glucocorticoids and also for designing more specific podocyte-targeted agents for MCN therapy."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80651GSE80715	Transcriptome analysis of chronic periodontitis patients' gingival tissue	We examined the molecular and cellular mechanism for chronic periodontitis in patients' gingival tissue by whole transcriptome sequencing.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80715GSE80716	Cooperation of Nutlin-3a and a Wip1 inhibitor to induce p53 activity	"Targeting the Mdm2 oncoprotein by drugs has the potential of re-establishing p53 function and tumor suppression. However, Mdm2-antagonizing drug candidates, e. g. Nutlin-3a, often fail to abolish cancer cell growth sustainably. To overcome these limitations, we inhibited Mdm2 and simultaneously a second negative regulator of p53, the phosphatase Wip1/PPM1D. When combining Nutlin-3a with the Wip1 inhibitor GSK2830371 in the treatment of p53-proficient but not p53-deficient cells, we observed enhanced phosphorylation (Ser 15) and acetylation (Lys 382) of p53, increased expression of p53 target gene products, and synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation. Surprisingly, when testing the two compounds individually, largely distinct sets of genes were induced, as revealed by deep sequencing analysis of RNA. In contrast, the combination of both drugs led to an expression signature that largely comprised that of Nutlin-3a alone. Moreover, the combination of drugs, or the combination of Nutlin-3a with Wip1-depletion by siRNA, activated p53-responsive genes to a greater extent than either of the compounds alone. Simultaneous inhibition of Mdm2 and Wip1 enhanced cell senescence and G2/M accumulation. Taken together, the inhibition of Wip1 might fortify p53-mediated tumor suppression by Mdm2 antagonists."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80716GSE80780	Human islets contain four distinct subtypes of  cells	"The transcriptomes of four subpopulations of beta cells isolated by FACS from five healthy human donors.

Since DHT is the precursor for estrogen receptor  (ER) ligands, 5AR inhibitors could potentially limit ER activation, which maintains prostate tissue homeostasis. We have uncovered signaling pathways in BPH-derived prostate epithelial cells (BPH-1) that are impacted by 5AR inhibition. The induction of apoptosis and repression of the cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin by the 5AR inhibitor, dutasteride, requires both ER and TGF. Dutasteride also induces cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2), which functions in a negative-feedback loop in TGF and ER signaling pathways as evidenced by the potentiation of apoptosis induced by dutasteride or finasteride upon pharmacological inhibition or shRNA-mediated ablation of COX-2. Concurrently, COX-2 positively impacts ER action through its effect on the expression of a number of steroidogenic enzymes in the ER-ligand metabolic pathway. Therefore, effective combination pharmacotherapies, which have included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, must take into account biochemical pathways affected by 5AR inhibition and opposing effects of COX-2 on the tissue protective action of ER."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80979GSE80988	"mRNA expression data from human parthenogenetic haploid ESCs (hPGES), normal ESCs (H9) and human fibroblast"	"Here we report the derivation of human haploid ESCs from parthenogenetic haploid embryos.

To understand how genetic variation and natural selection contribute to these differences, we tested for the effects of African versus European ancestry on the transcriptional response of primary macrophages to live bacterial pathogens. 12%% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection, and African ancestry specifically predicts a stronger inflammatory response and reduced intracellular bacterial growth. A large proportion of these differences are under genetic control: for 569 genes, more than 75%% of ancestry effects on the immune response can be explained by a single cis- or trans-acting eQTL. Finally, we show that genetic effects on the immune response are strongly enriched for recent, population-specific signatures of adaptation. Together, our results demonstrate how historical selective events continue to shape human phenotypic diversity today, including for traits that are central to coping with infection."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81046GSE81062	Targeting MTHFD2 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia	"Purpose: Identify new targets in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

RNA from 6 samples, biological duplicates (LacZ1, LacZ2; M5-1, M5-2) and a technical replicate (LacZ3, M5-3) were sequenced as 50+50 bp paired-end reads using Illumina TruSeq strand specific library. The pool of six samples was sequenced on two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq, generating 101bp paired end reads. The software package RSEM (Li et al., 2001) was run using Bowtie (version 1.0.0) to align the reads that passed quality filters to the hg19 GENCODE version 17 (http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/17.html) transcriptome and to quantify transcript abundance at isoform and gene level.

Using reporter lines to track the endothelial (SOX17) to haematopoietic (RUNX1C) transition, we found that hPSC differentiated in growth factor supplemented serum free medium generated RUNX1C+CD34+ clonogenic cells that homed to the bone marrow, but did not engraft. Compared to repopulation-competent cord blood CD34+ cells, RUNX1C+CD34+ progenitors lacked HOXA gene expression, indicating incorrect mesoderm patterning. This deficiency was ameliorated by a timed pulse of WNT activation combined with ACTIVIN antagonism. Significantly, these HOXA+ cultures now formed complex SOX17+ vessels that produced fetal liver-like haematopoietic cells, similar to the human aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM). Comparison of transcriptional profiles of these nascent haematopoietic stem/progenitors with cells isolated from human AGM confirmed significant similarities, consistent with the assignment of our in vitro generated cells to the definitive human haematopoietic lineage.

This is a challenging task, in particular in human tissues, because unique cell-type markers are typically unavailable, necessitating the analysis of complex cell type mixtures. Transcriptome-wide studies on pancreatic tissue are typically done on pooled islet material. To overcome this challenge we sequenced the transcriptome of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) allowing in silico purification of the different cell types. We identified the major pancreatic cell types resulting in the identification of many new cell-type specific and T2D-specific markers. Additionally we observed several subpopulations within the canonical pancreatic cell types, which we validated in situ.

Of 232 CTAs currently annotated in the CTdatabase, 96 were confirmed in NSCLC. To obtain an unbiased CTA profile of NSCLC, we applied stringent criteria on our RNAseq data set and defined 90 genes as CTAs, of which 55 genes were not annotated in the CTdatabase. Cluster analysis revealed that CTA expression is histology-dependent and concurrent expression is common. Immunohistochemistry confirmed tissue specific protein expression of selected genes. Furthermore, methylation was identified as a regulatory mechanism of CTA expression based on independent data from the Cancer Genome Atlas. The proposed prognostic impact of CTAs in lung cancer, was not confirmed, neither in our RNAseq-cohort nor in an independent meta-analysis of 1117 NSCLC cases."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81089GSE81147	"RNASeq of 4SU labelled nascent RNA in MV4;11 cell treated with DMSO, I-BET, SGC0946 and combination of I-BET and SGC0946"	"Central to the molecular pathogenesis of MLL leukaemia is the abnormal co-optation of members of transcription complexes including disrupter of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) and bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4).

"Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is a highly conserved pathway that selectively degrades specific subsets of RNA transcripts. Here, we provide evidence that NMD regulates early human developmental cell fate. We found that NMD factors tend to be expressed at higher levels in human pluripotent cells than differentiated cells, raising the possibility that NMD must be downregulated to permit differentiation. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) demonstrated that, indeed, NMD downregulation is essential for efficient generation of definitive endoderm. RNA-seq analysis identified NMD target transcripts induced when NMD is suppressed in hESCs, including many encoding signaling components. This led us to test the role of TGF-b and BMP signaling, which we found NMD acts through to influence definitive endoderm vs. mesoderm fate. Our results suggest that selective RNA decay is critical for specifying the developmental fate of specific human embryonic cell lineages."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81214GSE81266	Ileal pouch transcriptomics reveal shared pathogenesis between pouchitis and ulcerative colitis	"UC pouchitis is a potential model of UC. We prospectively examined the pouch transcriptomes of UC and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) IPAA patients to unveil molecular mechanisms of UC pouchitis susceptibility. Methods: Total RNA was isolated using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Cat No. 8020). RNA quality was evaluated using Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). All RNA samples displayed RNA Integrity Number (RIN) >7. RNAseq including cDNA library preparation was processed at the Genomics Core Facility of University of Chicago (https://fgf.uchicago.edu/). Total RNA in the amount of 100-500g per sample was depleted of ribosomal RNA using the Ribo-Zero kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI). The directional (first strand) cDNA libraries were prepared following the guide of TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation kit. Results: Unlike FAP patients, UC subjects exhibited a large set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pouch and pre-pouch mucosa as early as 4 months after pouch functionalization. Functional pathway analysis of DEGs in UC pouch revealed: (1) Gain of colon-associated gene expressions and loss of ileum associated gene expressions, (2) enhanced state of immune/inflammatory response, and (3) suppressed xenobiotic, lipid, and bile acid metabolic pathways. These changes were corroborated upon reanalysis of a published larger cross-sectional study of UC and FAP patients. Moreover, >70%% of DEGs mapped to published IBD and normal colonic microarray datasets displayed directional changes consistent with active UC, but not Crohn's disease.

Studies have shown that pluripotent cells with abnormal karyotypes may grow faster, differentiate less and become more resistance to apoptosis. Previously, we showed that microarray gene expression profiles can be utilized for the analysis of chromosomal aberrations by comparing gene expression levels between normal and aneuploid samples. Here we adopted this method for RNA-Seq data and present eSNP-Karyotyping for the detection of chromosomal aberrations, based on measuring the ratio of expression between the two alleles. We demonstrate its ability to detect chromosomal gains and losses in pluripotent cells and their derivatives, as well as meiotic recombination patterns. This method is advantageous since it does not require matched diploid samples for comparison, is less sensitive to global expression changes caused by the aberration, and utilizes already available gene expression profiles to determine chromosomal aberrations."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81402GSE81417	microRNAs with an AAGUGC seed motif constitute an integral part of a signaling network driving NSCLC cell proliferation	miR-372-3p target identification mRNA level	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81417GSE81439	Identification of an NKX3.1-G9a-UTY regulatory network that controls prostate differentiation (Human_RWPE1_RNA-Seq)	Analysis of transcriptome of human RWPE1 cells over-expressing wild type NKX3.1 and mutant NKX3.1 (T164A).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81439GSE81443	Plasma cell mitochondrial pyruvate import controls the duration of humoral immunity.

It was later found to be an auxiliary component of the Exon Junction Complex (EJC), which is deposited at exon junctions as a consequence of pre-mRNA splicing. To uncover the cellular functions of Acinus and investigate its role in splicing, we mapped its endogenous RNA targets using individual-nucleotide resolution UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP). We observed that Acinus binds to pre-mRNAs, associating specifically to a subset of suboptimal introns, but also to spliced mRNAs. We also confirmed the presence of Acinus as a peripheral factor of the EJC. RNA-seq was used to investigate changes in gene expression and alternative splicing following siRNA-mediated depletion of Acinus in HeLa cells. This analysis revealed that Acinus is preferentially required for the inclusion of specific alternative cassette exons and also controls the faithful splicing of a subset of introns. Moreover, a large number of splicing changes can be related to Acinus binding, suggesting a direct role of Acinus in exon and intron definition. In particular, Acinus regulates the splicing of DFFA/ICAD transcript, a major regulator of DNA fragmentation. Globally, the genome-wide identification of RNA targets of Acinus revealed its role in splicing regulation as well as its involvement in other cellular pathways, including cell cycle progression. Altogether, this study uncovers new cellular functions of an RBP transiently associated with the EJC"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81460GSE81469	Regulation of highly expressed hCINAP on translatome	"hCINAP is essential for human 18S rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. hCINAP is highly expressed in human cancers and promotes cancer cell growth.

However, the role of alternative splicing (AS) in the temporal control of cell cycle is not well understood. By sequencing the human transcriptome through two continuous cell cycles, we identify ~1,300 genes with cell cycle-dependent AS changes. These genes are significantly enriched in functions linked to cell cycle control, yet they do not significantly overlap genes subject to periodic changes in steady-state transcript levels. Many of the periodically spliced genes are controlled by the SR protein kinase CLK1, whose level undergoes cell cycle-dependent fluctuations via an auto-inhibitory circuit. Disruption of CLK1 causes pleiotropic cell cycle defects and loss of proliferation, whereas CLK1 over-expression is associated with various cancers. These results thus reveal a large program of CLK1-regulated periodic AS intimately associated with cell cycle control."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81485GSE81507	Post-transcriptional manipulation of TERC reverses molecular hallmarks of telomere disease	"The telomerase RNA component (TERC) is a critical determinant of cellular self renewal. Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is required for post-transcriptional maturation of TERC. PARN mutations lead to incomplete 3 end processing and increased destruction of nascent TERC RNA transcripts, resulting in telomerase deficiency and telomere diseases. Here, we determined that overexpression of TERC increased telomere length in PARN-deficient cells and hypothesized that decreasing post-transcriptional 3 oligo-adenylation of TERC would counteract the deleterious effects of PARN mutations. Inhibition of the noncanonical poly(A) polymerase PAP-associated domaincontaining 5 (PAPD5) increased TERC levels in PARN-mutant patient cells. PAPD5 inhibition was also associated with increases in TERC stability, telomerase activity, and telomere elongation. Our results demonstrate that manipulating post-transcriptional regulatory pathways may be a potential strategy to reverse the molecular hallmarks of telomere disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81507GSE81513	Splicing towards noncoding isoforms in colorectal carcinoma is associated with tumor hypoxia and the DNA damage response	"Tumor hypoxia is associated with poor patient outcome and resistance to therapy.

Uridylated pre-miRNAs in mammals and uridylated mRNAs in fission yeast are targeted by the 3 to 5 exoribonuclease DIS3L2. In humans, DIS3L2 mutations have been associated with Perlman syndrome development and Wilms tumor susceptibility. In this work, we employ crosslinking in vivo and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) method to assess the RNA binding capacity of human DIS3L2 on a genome-wide scale. Our study uncovers a broad spectrum of uridylated RNAs in human cytoplasm, which include mature as well as aberrant forms of coding and noncoding RNAs, such as rRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, tRNAs and pre-miRNAs. Most importantly, we have identified that a fraction of Pol II transcription start-site associated transcripts are exported to cytoplasm, where they are targeted by the TUT-DIS3L2 pathway. Moreover, this pathway appears to mainly target RNA regions that form stable secondary structures. Our findings imply the role of DIS3L2 and oligouridylation in general RNA quality control of most, if not all RNA classes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81534GSE81550	RNA-Seq expression profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues	Three pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent non-tumor tissues were from 3 male patients suffering from stage I or II HCC with hepatitis C virus background.

The expression of CONCR is cell cycle-regulated, and it is required for cell cycle progression and DNA replication. Moreover, cells depleted of CONCR show severe defects in sister chromatid cohesion, suggesting an essential role for CONCR in cohesion establishment during cell division. CONCR interacts with and regulates the activity of DDX11, a DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase involved in DNA replication. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of action for CONCR in the modulation of DDX11 enzymatic activity, unveiling the direct involvement of a lncRNA in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81601GSE81608	RNA Sequencing of Single Human Islet Cells Reveals Type 2 Diabetes Genes	"Pancreatic islet cells are critical for maintaining normal blood glucose levels and their malfunction underlies diabetes development and progression.

However, the dynamics of epigenetic modifications and their regulation to initiate ME differentiation remain elusive. In this study, we report that H3K27me3 is decreased during ME initiation, which is essential for the subsequent differentiation by collaborative effects of Activin and Wnt signaling. Mechanistically, Activin decreases the H3K27me3 level via disruption of the SUZ12-EZH2 interaction and EZH2 degradation mediated by Smad2. Our data suggest a two-step process of ME initiation: firstly H3K27me3-marked epigenetic priming and secondly transcription activation.

Although multiple functions have been ascribed to lincRNA, their synthesis and turnover remain poorly characterised. Here we define systematic differences in transcription and RNA processing between protein-coding and lincRNA genes in human HeLa cells. This is based on a range of nascent transcriptomic approaches applied to different nuclear fractions, including mammalian native elongating transcript sequencing (mNET-seq). Notably mNET-seq patterns specific for different Pol II CTD phosphorylation states reveal weak co-transcriptional splicing and poly(A) signal independent Pol II termination on lincRNA as compared to pre-mRNA. In addition, lincRNA are mostly restricted to chromatin where they are co-transcriptionally degraded by the RNA exosome. We also show that a lincRNA specific co-transcriptional RNA cleavage mechanism acts to induce premature termination. In effect functional lincRNA must escape from this targeted nuclear surveillance process."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81662GSE81671	Genome models integrating chromatin contacts and nuclear lamin-genome interactions reveal implications of laminopathy-causing lamin mutations on genome architecture	"Processes shaping the 3-dimensional (3D) human genome remain elusive.

We integrate Hi-C and lamin-associated domain (LAD) information to generate high-resolution ensembles of models that recapitulate single-cell TAD distribution. Chrom3D reveals dynamic TADs and TADs constitutively placed at the nuclear periphery or nuclear interior. TAD stability in these compartments is consistent with differences in TAD gene density and expression level. A- and B-type lamins as radial constraints differentially skew LAD distribution towards the nuclear interior or periphery. Predictions of radial LAD placement in model ensembles are validated by quantitative imaging. Chrom3D models reveal unexpected features of LAD regulation in the nuclear interior in cells from laminopathy patients with a LMNA mutation.

Histone modification and DNA methylation states in iPSCs have been shown to be highly similar with embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, epigenetic differences still exist between iPSCs and ESCs. In particular, aberrant DNA methylation states found in iPSCs are a major concern for using iPSCs in a clinical setting. Thus, it is critical to find factors that regulate DNA methylation states in reprogramming. Here, we found that the miR-29 family is an important epigenetic regulator during human somatic cell reprogramming. Our global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation analysis shows that DNA demethylation is a major event mediated by miR-29a depletion during early reprogramming, and that iPSCs derived from miR-29a depletion are epigenetically closer to ESCs.

A combination of three cardiac transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT), can convert fibroblasts into iCMs, albeit with low efficiency in vitro. Here, we screened 5,500 compounds in primary cardiac fibroblasts and found that a combination of the transforming growth factor (TGF)- inhibitor SB431542 and the WNT inhibitor XAV939 increased reprogramming efficiency eight-fold when added to GMT-overexpressing cardiac fibroblasts. The small-molecules also enhanced the speed and the quality of cell conversion, as we observed beating cells as early as 1 week after reprogramming compared to 68 weeks with GMT alone. In vivo, mice exposed to GMT, SB431542, and XAV939 for 2 weeks after myocardial infarction showed significantly improved reprogramming and cardiac function compared to those exposed to only GMT. Human cardiac reprogramming was similarly enhanced upon TGF-b and WNT inhibition and was achieved most efficiently with GMT plus Myocardin. Thus, TGF- and WNT inhibitors jointly enhance GMT-induced direct cardiac reprogramming from cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo and provide a more robust platform for cardiac regeneration."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81809GSE81810	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of HIV-1 Latency in Central Memory T Cells	"Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a powerful microscope to study cell models of HIV. The goals of this study is to analyze latent HIV infection in the TCM model of HIV latency described in Martins et al 2015 and to evaluate potential markers for HIV infection. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 4 healthy donors. Naive CD4 T cells were isolated and utilized to generate a model of latent HIV infection. During model generation, cells were sorted and collected for RNA extraction 10 days post infection along with their uninfected counterparts. 2 days after this, cells were activated with CD3/CD28 stimulation and collected for study for a total of 16 samples from 4 donors. After cell collection, RNA was extracted from infected cells and their uninfected counterparts for deep sequencing by Expression Analysis. Sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped using Tophat and counted using HTSeq. In addition to human transcripts, we utilized 92 ERCC spikes as negative controls. Any human gene which did not achieve at least 1 count per million reads in at least 4 samples or any ERCC that did not achieve at least 5 reads in at least 4 samples was discarded. Differential expression for activated samples was not performed, but rather used to demonstrate upregulation of T-cell activation markers along with changing to the type and abundance of HIV transcripts produced. Results: Using an custom built data analysis pipeline, 82 million reads per sample to the human genome (build hg38) and identified 13,534 human transcripts 67 ERCC spike in transcripts, and HIV NL43 transcripts were identified with the Tophat/HTSeq workflow. Differential expression analysis was performed between uninfected and latently infected cells. 826 genes were found to be differentially expressed, 275 downregulated and 551 upregulated (FDR < 0.05) with EdgeR. GO and Pathway analysis of differential expressed genes revealed significant dysregulation of genes involved in the p53 signaling pathway. Subsequent studies with pifithrin demonstrated a reduction in latently infected cell during model generation. Conclusions: This study represents the first detailed analysis of HIV latency with this cell model using next generations sequencing. These results demonstrate that the TCM model of HIV latency of Martins et al 2015 is truly reflective of HIV latency. This study also provides a framework for which to analyze future cell models of HIV latency using next generation sequencing. Finally, this work demonstrates that the p53 signaling pathway is a key pathway dysregulated in latency for this cell model with several genes dysregulated in HIV latency."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81810GSE81817	Glutamine Deficiency Occurs in Regions of Solid Tumours and Promotes Dedifferentiation through Inhibition of Histone Demethylation	We sequenced mRNA from the core regions and the peripheral regions of melanoma xenograft tumors	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81817GSE81826	Inheritable Silencing of Endogenous Genes by Hit-and-Run Targeted Epigenetic Editing	"Gene silencing is a powerful approach for interrogating gene function and holds promise for therapeutic applications. Here we repurpose the ERV silencing machinery of embryonic stem cells to stably silence genes in somatic cells by epigenetics. This was achieved by transiently expressing combinations of artificial transcriptional repressors that bind to and synergize at the target locus to instruct de novo DNA methylation, thus ensuing long-term memory of the repressive epigenetic state. Silencing was highly specific and sharply confined to the targeted gene, was resistant to activation induced by cytokine stimulation and could be relieved only by targeted DNA demethylation. We demonstrate the portability of this technology by silencing three highly transcribed genes, B2M, IFNAR1, and VEGFA, using multiple DNA binding platforms and interrogating thousands of genomic loci after reporter insertion in different cell types, including primary T-lymphocytes. Finally, we expanded the breadth of targeted epigenome editing by multiplex gene silencing, setting the stage for its application in research and medicine."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81826GSE81916	AKAP95 regulates splicing through scaffolding RNAs and RNA processing factors	"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs significantly contributes to the complexity of gene expression in higher organisms, but the regulation of the splice site selection remains incompletely understood. We have previously demonstrated that a chromatin-associated protein, AKAP95 (AKAP8), has a remarkable activity in enhancing chromatin transcription. In this study, we have shown that AKAP95 physically interacts with many factors involved in transcription and RNA processing, and functionally regulates pre-mRNA splicing. AKAP95 directly promotes splicing in vitro and the inclusion of a specific exon of an endogenous gene FAM126A. The N-terminal YG-rich domain of AKAP95 is important for its binding to RNA processing factors including selective groups of hnRNP proteins, and its zinc finger domains are critical for pre-mRNA binding. Genome-wide binding assays revealed that AKAP95 bound preferentially to proximal intronic regions on a large number of pre-mRNAs in human transcriptome, and AKAP95 depletion predominantly resulted in reduced inclusion of many exons. AKAP95 also selectively coordinates with hnRNP H/F and U proteins in regulating alternative splicing events. We have further shown that AKAP95 directly interacts with itself. Taken together, our results establish AKAP95 as a novel and mostly positive regulator of pre-mRNA splicing and a possible integrator of transcription and splicing regulation, and support a model that AKAP95 regulates pre-mRNA splicing via through scaffolding RNAs and RNA processing factors and facilitating the splice site communication."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81916GSE81982	The genome wide transcriptional profiling of periodontitis-associated fibroblasts identified DLX5 and RUNX2 as central regulatory elements [RNA-seq]	RNA-seq of normal gingival fibroblasts	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81982GSE81995	Hydrogel scaffolds promote neural gene expression and structural reorganization in human astrocyte cultures	"Biomaterial scaffolds have the potential to enhance neuronal development and regeneration. Understanding the genetic responses of astrocytes and neurons to biomaterials could facilitate the development of synthetic environments that enable the specification of neural tissue organization with engineered scaffolds. In this study, we used high throughput transcriptomic and imaging methods to determine the impact of a hydrogel with no known bioactive epitopes, Puramatrix, on human glial cells in vitro. Parallel studies were undertaken with cells grown in a monolayer environment on tissue culture polystyrene. When the Normal Human Astrocyte (NHA) cell line is grown in a hydrogel matrix environment, the glial cells adopt a structural organization that resembles that of neuronal-glial cocultures, where neurons form clusters that are distinct from the surrounding glia. Statistical analysis of next generation RNA sequencing data uncovered a set of genes that are differentially expressed in the monolayer and matrix hydrogel environments. Functional analysis demonstrated that hydrogel-upregulated genes can be grouped into three broad categories: neuronal differentiation and/or neural plasticity, response to neural insult, and sensory perception.

We compared epigenomic and gene regulatory features in cerebral organoids and human fetal brain, using genome-wide, base resolution DNA methylome and transcriptome sequencing. Transcriptomic dynamics in organoids faithfully modeled gene expression trajectories in early-to-mid human fetal brains. We found that early non-CG methylation accumulation at super-enhancers in both fetal brain and organoids marks forthcoming transcriptional repression in the fully developed brain. 74%% of 35,627 demethylated regions identified during organoid differentiation overlapped with fetal brain regulatory elements. Interestingly, pericentromeric repeats showed widespread demethylation in multiple types of in vitro human neural differentiation models but not in fetal brain.

It is unclear if aggressive phenotypes of prostate cancer molecularly resemble normal stem cells residing within the human prostate. We performed high-throughput RNA sequencing on uncultured, highly purified epithelial populations from human prostates obtained after radical prostatectomy. We found the basal population to be defined by genes associated with developmental programs, epigenetic remodeling, and invasiveness. We further generated a 91-gene basal signature and applied it to gene expression datasets from patients with organ-confined or castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer. Metastatic prostate cancer was more enriched for the basal stem cell signature than organ-confined prostate cancer. Moreover, histological subtypes within prostate cancer metastases varied in their enrichment of the stem cell signature with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma being the most stem cell-like. Bioinformatic analysis of the basal cell and two human small cell gene signatures identified a set of E2F target genes common to all three signatures.

Here, we report that ORF10 of Kaposis sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a nuclear DNA virus, inhibits mRNA export in a transcript-selective manner to control cellular gene expression. This export inhibitory effect of ORF10 requires the interaction with an RNA export factor, Rae1. Genome-wide analysis by RNA sequencing revealed the subset of cellular mRNAs whose nuclear export is blocked by ORF10. The 3 untranslated regions (3 UTRs) of ORF10-targeted transcripts confer their sensitivity to nuclear export inhibition by ORF10. In the context of KSHV replication, the interaction of ORF10 with Rae1 is important for the virus to express viral genes and produce infectious virions. Our results suggest that a nuclear replicating DNA virus can selectively interfere with RNA export through Rae1 to restrict host gene expression for optimal viral replication."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE82241GSE82289	BRD4 localization to lineage-specific enhancers is associated with a distinct transcription factor repertoire [mRNA-Seq]	We examined context specific function of BRD4 in promoting lineage specific gene expression and show that BRD4 is essential for osteoblast differentiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE82289GSE82329	Adaptation of the Kinome Promotes Resistance to BET Bromodomain Inhibitors in Ovarian Cancer	"Small molecule BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) are actively being pursued in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of cancers, however, the mechanisms of resistance to targeted BET protein inhibitors remain poorly understood. Using a novel mass spectrometry approach that globally measures kinase signaling at the proteomic level, we evaluated the response of the kinome to targeted BET inhibitor treatment in a panel of BRD4-dependent ovarian carcinoma (OC) cell lines. Despite initial inhibitory effects of BETi, OC cells acquired resistance following sustained treatment with the BETi, JQ1. Through application of Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) and mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that BETi resistance is mediated by adaptive kinome reprogramming, where activation of compensatory pro-survival kinase networks overcomes BET protein inhibition. Furthermore, drug combinations blocking these kinases may prevent or delay the development of drug resistance and enhance the efficacy of BET inhibitor therapy."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE82329GSE82336	Perlman syndrome nuclease DIS3L2 controls cytoplasmic non-coding RNAs and provides surveillance pathway for maturing snRNAs	"The exosome-independent exoribonuclease DIS3L2 is mutated in Perlman syndrome. Here we used extensive global transcriptomic and targeted biochemical analyses to identify novel DIS3L2 substrates in human cells. We show that DIS3L2 regulates pol II transcripts, comprising selected canonical and histone-coding mRNAs, and a novel FTL_short RNA from the ferritin mRNA 5' UTR. Importantly, DIS3L2 contributes to surveillance of pre-snRNAs during their cytoplasmic maturation. Among pol III transcripts, DIS3L2 particularly targets vault and Y RNAs and an Alu-like element BC200 RNA, but not Alu repeats, which are removed by exosome-associated DIS3. Using 3' RACE-Seq, we demonstrate that all novel DIS3L2 substrates are uridylated in vivo by TUT4/TUT7 poly(U) polymerases. Uridylation-dependent DIS3L2-mediated decay can be recapitulated in vitro, thus reinforcing the tight cooperation between DIS3L2 and TUTases. Together these results indicate that catalytically inactive DIS3L2, characteristic of Perlman syndrome, can lead to deregulation of its target RNAs to disturb transcriptome homeostasis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE82336GSE83100	Epigenomic remodeling of the PAX8 cistrome in high grade serous ovarian cancer [RNA-Seq]	"We report mapping of the PAX8 cistrome in three high grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines (KURAMOCHI, OVSAHO, and JHOS4) compared to three benign immortalized fallopian tube cell lines (FT33, FT194, and FT246).

To better understand the tissue-specific expression characteristics of transcripts in different human tissues, we deeply sequenced RNA samples from 14 different human tissues. After filtering many lowly expressed transcripts, 24,729 protein-coding transcripts and 1,653 noncoding transcripts were identified. By analyzing highly expressed tissue-specific protein-coding transcripts (TSCTs) and noncoding transcripts (TSNTs), we found that testis expressed the highest numbers of TSCTs and TSNTs. Brain, monocytes, ovary, and heart expressed more TSCTs than the rest tissues, whereas brain, placenta, heart, and monocytes expressed more TSNTs than other tissues. Co-expression network constructed based on the TSCTs and TSNTs showed that each hub TSNT was co-expressed with several TSCTs, allowing functional annotation of TSNTs. Important biological processes and KEGG pathways highly related to the specific functions or diseases of each tissue were enriched with the corresponding TSCTs. These TSCTs and TSNTs may participate in the tissue-specific physiological or pathological processes. Our study provided a unique data set and systematic analysis of expression characteristics and functions of both TSCTs and TSNTs based on 14 distinct human tissues, and could facilitate future investigation of the mechanisms behind tissue-specific diseases and adverse drug reactions."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE83115GSE83139	"Single cell RNA-seq of human pancreatic endocrine cells from Juvenile, adult control and type 2 diabetic donors."

The phenotypes and transcriptional patterns of the PKD disease need further clarification. Here, we report the generation and neural differentiation of iPSC lines from two familial PKD patients with c.487C>T (p. Gln163X) and c.573dupT (p. Gly192Trpfs*8) PRRT2 mutations, respectively. Notably, an extremely lower efficiency in neural conversion from PKD-iPSCs than control-iPSCs is observed by using the iPSC-neural differentiation protocol that relies on the dual inhibition of SMAD signaling. Moreover, we show the high expression level of PRRT2 throughout the human brain and the expression pattern of PRRT2 in other human tissues for the first time. To gain molecular insight into the development of the disease, we conduct global gene expression profiling of PKD cells at four different stages of neural induction and identify altered gene expression patterns, which peculiarly reflect dysregulated neural transcriptome signatures and a differentiation tendency to mesodermal development, in comparison to control-iPSCs. Additionally, functional and signaling pathway analyses indicate significantly different cell fate determination between PKD-iPSCs and controls-iPSCs. Together, the establishment of PKD-specific in vitro models and the illustration of transcriptome features in PKD cells would certainly help us with better understanding of the defects in neural conversion as well as further investigations in the pathogenesis of the PKD disease."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE83256GSE83266	The -catenin/CBP-antagonist ICG-001 inhibits pediatric glioma tumorigenicity in a Wnt-independent manner	"In pediatric glioma cell lines, treatment with ICG-001 had no inhibitory effect on canonical Wnt-target genes but induced significant up regulation of various known -catenin target genes in both cell lines and top 20 GO-annotations of down-regulated genes by ICG-001 were associated with biosynthetic and metabolic processes and cell cycle division processes."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE83266GSE83314	Normal stroma suppresses cancer cell proliferation via mechanosensitive regulation of JMJD1a-mediated transcription [RNA-Seq]	gene expression data from 3 pairs of cancer associated fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts from the same individual	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE83314GSE83322	Next Generation Sequencing of liver and subcutaneous fat tissues obtained from obese subjects	Patients had low calorie diet weight reduction run in prior to the day of surgery.

The enzymes that catalyze these activities are often contained within multiprotein complexes in nature. Two such multiprotein complexes, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) methyltransferase and the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeler have been reported to act in opposition to each other during development and homeostasis. An imbalance in their activities induced by mutations/deletions in complex members (e.g. SMARCB1) has been suggested to be a pathogenic mechanism in certain human cancers. Here we show that preclinical models of synovial sarcoma - a cancer characterized by functional SMARCB1 loss via its displacement from the SWI/SNF complex through the pathognomonic SS18-SSX fusion protein - display sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2. Treatment with tazemetostat, a clinical-stage, selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 enzymatic activity reverses a subset of synovial sarcoma gene expression and results in concentration-dependent cell growth inhibition and cell death specifically in SS18-SSX fusion-positive cells in vitro. Treatment of mice bearing either a cell line or two patient-derived xenograft models of synovial sarcoma leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition with correlative inhibition of trimethylation levels of the EZH2-specific substrate, lysine 27 on histone H3. These data demonstrate a dependency of SS18-SSX-positive, SMARCB1-deficient synovial sarcomas on EZH2 enzymatic activity and suggests the potential utility of EZH2-targeted drugs in these genetically defined cancers."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE83479GSE83482	Multiple Origins of Virus Persistence during Natural Control of HIV Infection	"Targeted HIV cure strategies require definition of the mechanisms that maintain the virus.

Our results revealed three mechanisms of HIV persistence operating within distinct anatomic and functional compartments. In lymph node, we detected viruses with genetic and transcriptional attributes of active replication in both T follicular helper (TFH) cells and non-TFH memory cells. In blood, we detected inducible proviruses of archival origin among highly differentiated, clonally expanded cells. Linking the lymph node and blood was a small population of circulating cells harboring inducible proviruses of recent origin. Thus, HIV replication in lymphoid tissue, clonal expansion of infected cells, and recirculation of recently infected cells act together to maintain the virus in HIV controllers despite effective antiviral immunity."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE83482GSE83484	RNA sequencing of human fibroblasts after SUPT4H1 siRNA treatment	"Asses the transcriptome-wide changes associated with depletion of transcription elongation factor, SUPT4H1, in human fibroblasts. An expanded hexanucleotide repeat in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (c9FTD/ALS). Therapeutics (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides) are being developed to target RNAs containing the expanded repeat sequence (GGGGCC); however, this approach is complicated by the presence of antisense strand transcription of expanded GGCCCC repeats. We found that targeting the transcription elongation factor, Spt4, selectively decreased production of both sense and antisense expanded transcripts, as well as their translated dipeptide repeat (DPR) products, and also mitigated degeneration in animal models. Inhibition of SUPT4H1, the human ortholog of Spt4, similarly decreased production of sense and antisense RNA foci as well as DPR proteins in c9ALS patient fibroblasts and neurons from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, consistent with our finding that cerebellar DPR protein levels correlate with SUPT4H1 expression in c9FTD/ALS patients.

Here, we observe for the first time that these phenotypic changes are accompanied by large-scale reorganization of the genomic architecture that encodes the GCB-cell transcriptional program. The coordinate expression of genes that specify the GCB-cell phenotype  most prominently, BCL6  is achieved through a non-random, multilayered, chromatin reorganization process involving i) increased promoter connectivity, ii) formation of higher-order enhancer networks, iii) 5 to 3 gene looping, and iv) merging of gene neighborhoods that share active epigenetic marks. These cell-specific events are closely linked to binding of GC transcription factors and the structural proteins CTCF and cohesin. The gene encoding the GC master regulator, BCL6, is an anchor point for the formation of GC-specific gene and enhancer loops on chromosome 3. Furthermore, through CRISPR-mediated knockout we demonstrate that a putative locus control region upstream of Bcl6 is required for GCB-cell formation in mice. Thus, architectural reorganization of phenotype-driving gene sets, including assembly of cell type-specific promoter and enhancer networks, may be key to controlling tissue-specific gene expression programs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84022GSE84023	RNA sequencing of patient derived cell lines in pancreatic cancer	Gene expression levels of pancreatic cell lines	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84023GSE84085	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Human Primary and Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Epicardial Cell Transcriptomes	"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has significantly advanced the elucidation of developmental signaling mechanisms that are important for different cell lineage formation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We report here the application of RNA-sequencing technology for transcriptome profile of human primary and hPSC-derived epicardial cell, and compare to those of other cell lineages including hPSCs, mesoderm, cardiomcyotyes. Eight epicaridal cell samples from four different hPSC lines and four different donors were performed in IIIumina HiSeq2500.

These data demonstrate the power of IPSC differentiation technology to generate defined cell types such as endothelial cells as translational in vitro model to compare cell type specific responses across species.

CRPC-derived VCaP cells display an excessive number of chromatin AR-binding sites (ARBs). This study analyzed direct transcription programs of the AR, the prevalence of AR enhancers and the transcriptional regulators involved in the regulation of at the enhancer regions. The analysis utilized global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq). The GRO-seq data were integrated with the ARB and VCaP cell-specific transcription factor-binding data. Androgen in 30 min activated and repressed transcription of a large number of genes including novel AR targets IGF-1 receptor and EGF receptor. GRO-seq analysis also revealed that only a fraction of the ARBs resides at functional enhancers. Activation of AR bound enhancers was most potent at the sites that also bound PIAS1, ERG and HDAC3. Our genome-wide data provide new insights how AR can directly control growth-signaling pathways in CPRC cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84432GSE84471	A Druggable TCF4- and BRD4-dependent Transcriptional Network Sustains Malignancy in Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (RNA-Seq)	"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an aggressive and largely incurable hematologic malignancy originating from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Using RNA interference screening, we identified the E-box transcription factor TCF4 as a master regulator of the BPDCN oncogenic program. TCF4 served as a faithful diagnostic marker of BPDCN, and its downregulation caused the loss of the BPDCN-specific expression program and apoptosis. High-throughput drug screening revealed that bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitors (BETi's) induce BPDCN apoptosis, which was attributable to disruption of the TCF4-dependent transcriptional network and loss of BPDCN-specific super-enhancers. BETi's retarded the growth of BPDCN xenografts, supporting their clinical evaluation in this recalcitrant malignancy."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84471GSE84537	DMS-MaPseq: A genome-wide or targeted approach for RNA structure probing in vivo	"Here we present dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq), which encodes DMS modifications as mismatches using a thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase (TGIRT).

Perturbations in ENS development or function are common, yet a human model to study ENS-intestinal biology is lacking. We have used a tissue engineering approach with pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to generate human intestinal tissue containing a functional ENS. We recapitulated normal intestinal ENS development by combining PSC-derived neural crest cells (NCCs) with developing human intestinal organoids (HIOs). When cultured alone, NCCs had full differentiation potential in vitro, however when recombined with HIOs they differentiated into neurons and glial cells. NCC-derived ENS neurons self-assembled within the developing intestinal mesenchyme and exhibited neuronal activity as measured by rhythmic waves of calcium transients. ENS-containing HIOs grown in vivo formed neuroglial structures similar to a myenteric and submucosal plexus, formed interstitial cells of Cajal, and had an electro-mechanical coupling that regulated waves of propagating contraction.

Only a small fraction of lncRNAs possess demonstrated regulatory functions, making it difficult to distinguish functional lncRNAs from non-functional transcriptional byproducts. This has resulted in numerous competing incoherent annotations of human lncRNA. To address these challenges, we quantitatively examined transcription, splicing, degradation, localization and translation for coding and non-coding human genes. Annotated lncRNAs had lower synthesis and higher degradation rates than mRNAs. We discovered mechanistic differences explaining the slower splicing of lncRNAs. We grouped genes into coherent classes by performing annotation-agnostic unsupervised classification of RNA metabolism profiles. These classes contained both mRNAs and lncRNAs to varying degrees; they exhibited distinct relationships between steps of RNA metabolism, evolutionary patterns, and sensitivity to cellular RNA regulatory pathways. Our classification provides a functionally coherent alternative to genomic context-driven annotations of lncRNAs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84722GSE84815			GSE84875	Gene expression analysis of parental cell lines and cell lines with acquired resistance to compound 3 (C03) and compound 7 (C07).

Emerging evidence implicates a key role for nonmutational mechanisms including changes in cell state during early stages of acquired drug resistance. Targeting nonmutational resistance may therefore present a therapeutic opportunity to eliminate residual surviving tumor cells and impede relapse. A variety of cancer cell lines harbor quiescent, reversibly drug-tolerant persister cells which survive cytotoxic drugs including targeted therapies and chemotherapies. These persister cells survive drug through nonmutational mechanisms which are poorly understood. Specifically targeting persister cells is a promising strategy to prevent tumor relapse. We sought to identify therapeutically exploitable vulnerabilities in persister cells using the HER2-amplified breast cancer line BT474 as an experimental model. Similar to other persister cell models, upon treatment with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib (2uM concentration) for nine or more days, the majority of BT474 cells die, revealing a small population of quiescent surviving persister cells. Removal of lapatinib allows the persister cells to regrow and to re-acquire sensitivity to lapatinib. Subsequent lapatinib treatment re-derives persister cells. The reversibility of persister cell drug resistance indicates a nonmutational resistance mechanism. Here we provide RNAseq gene expression profiling data generated from parental BT474 cells compared to BT474 persister cells generated from nine days of treatment with 2 uM lapatinib. These data can be used to identify genes and pathways which are upregulated in persister cells, revealing potential therapeutic targets."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84896GSE84944	N6-methyladenosine (m6A) sequencing of messenger RNAs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with and without knockdown of FTO	"To identify potential mRNA targets of FTO whose m6A levels are influenced in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, we conducted m6A-seq for mRNA isolated from MA9.3ITD cells with and without knockdown of FTO"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84944GSE85008	mRNA sequencing in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with and without knockdown of FTO	"To identify the expression of mRNAs after knockdown of FTO, we performed RNA-Seq in MA9.3ITD cells with or without knockdown of FTO."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85008GSE85088	CTCF modulates Estrogen Receptor function through specific chromatin and nuclear matrix interactions [RNA-seq]	"In our work we used high-throughput sequencing methods to get insight in the role of CTCF in ER-mediated gene regulation in luminal breast cancer cells.

Aberrant HOX expression is found in nearly all AMLs that harbor a mutation in the Nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene, and FLT3 is concomitantly mutated in approximately 60%% of these cases. Little is known how mutant NPM1 (NPM1mut) cells maintain aberrant gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that the histone modifiers MLL1 and DOT1L control HOX and FLT3 expression and differentiation in NPM1mut AML. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing domain screen, we show NPM1mut AML to be exceptionally dependent on the menin binding site in MLL1. Pharmacological small-molecule inhibition of the menin-MLL protein interaction had profound anti-leukemic activity in human and murine models of NPM1mut AML in vitro and in vivo. Combined pharmacological inhibition of menin-MLL and DOT1L resulted in dramatic suppression of HOX and FLT3 expression, induction of differentiation, and superior activity against NPM1mut leukemia. Together, MLL1 and DOT1L are chromatin regulators that control HOX, MEIS1 and FLT3 expression and are therapeutic targets in NPM1mut AML. Combinatorial small-molecule inhibition has synergistic on target activity and constitutes a novel therapeutic concept for this common AML subtype."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85107GSE85133	Recurrent somatic mutations in POLR2A define a distinct subset of meningiomas [RNA-seq]	"RNA polymerase II mediates the transcription of all protein-coding genes in eukaryotic cells, a process that is fundamental to life.

As subset was characterized by RNA seq and compared to expression profiles of published primary and induced samples. ABSTRACT: Microglia, the only lifelong resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are highly specialized macrophages which have been recognized to play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons and Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). However, in contrast to other cell types of the human CNS, bona fide microglia have not yet been derived from cultured human pluripotent stem cells. Here we establish a robust and efficient protocol for the rapid production of microglia-like cells from human embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that uses defined serum-free culture conditions. These in vitro pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells (termed pMGLs) faithfully recapitulate the expected ontogeny and characteristics of their in vivo counterparts and resemble primary fetal human and mouse microglia. We generated these cells from multiple disease-specific cell lines, and find that pMGLs derived from MeCP2 mutant hES cells are smaller than their isogenic controls. We further describe a culture platform to study integration and live behavior of pMGLs in organotypic 3D-cultures. This modular differentiation system allows the study of microglia in highly defined conditions, as they mature in response to developmentally relevant cues, and provides a framework to study the long-term interaction of microglia residing in a tissue-like environment."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85839GSE85840	"Transcriptional changes induced by Brd4 inhibitor, AZD5153, in cancer cell lines"	We sequenced mRNA from 12 human cancer cell lines treated with DMSO or AZD5153 for 24h to determine compound mechanism of action	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85840GSE85854	Transcriptome analysis of alternative splicing events in WT and P-KO H9 cells	We have used RNA-seq to explore alternative splicing events in WT and P-KO H9 cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85854GSE85861	Novel gene expression profile of women with intrinsic skin youthfulness by transcriptome sequencing	"Our study is an unbiased, whole transcriptome search for genes associate with intrinsic skin youthfulness in healthy volunteers that is controlled for co-variates.

Here we carry out whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of a multi-institutional cohort of MTSCC (n=22). We demonstrate the presence of either biallelic loss of Hippo pathway tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and/or evidence of alteration of Hippo pathway genes in 85%% of samples. PTPN14 (31%%) and NF2 (22%%) were the most commonly implicated Hippo pathway genes while other genes such as SAV1 and HIPK2 were also involved in a mutually exclusive fashion. Mutations in the context of recurrent chromosomal losses amounted to bi-allelic alterations in these TSGs. As a read-out of Hippo pathway inactivation, a majority of cases (90%%) exhibited increased nuclear YAP1 protein expression. To identify transcriptional targets of the Hippo pathway in kidney we performed PTPN14 knockdown followed by RNA-seq in 2 kidney cancer cell lines (CAKI-1 and A-704) and a normal kidney epithelial cell line (HK-2). PTPN14 siRNAs were first functionally validated in a MCF-7 TEAD reporter luciferase stable cell line. Both siRNAs showed comparable knockdown efficiency and significantly increased luciferase reporter activity. In 2 of the kidney cell lines PTPN14 knockdown increased cell proliferation compared to non-target controls. While we observed excellent correlation between genes dysregulated by either PTPN14 or LATS1 knockdown within each cell line (HK2, CAKI-1 and A704), the overlap across the 3 cell lines was only 23 genes. Further, these 23 genes did not show concordant differential expression in MTSCC tumors. Overall, these results illustrate the marked tissue specificity of Hippo pathway targets.Finally, taken together, nearly all cases of MTSCC exhibit some evidence of Hippo pathway dysregulation."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85969GSE86053	Human Osteosarcoma Transcriptome	"Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most aggressive bone malignancy. Sub-optimal therapy has irretrievably compromised chances of survival of OS patients for years. Also lack of extensive research on this rare disease has hindered its therapeutic development. Cisplatin (CDDP) is an integral part of current treatment regime for OS. However, despite the proven benefits of CDDP, acquisition of resistance impedes therapy. Also, the molecular effects post CDDP insult in OS cells is poorly understood. Hence, we characterized molecular alterations associated with CDDP-exposure and resistance in OS cells. Resistance to CDDP in OS cells was developed and deep sequencing of mRNA was performed. It depicted an altered transcriptomic signature of resistant cells with enrichment of pathways regulating proliferation. Overall, a significant up-regulation of coding-RNAs and down-regulation of non-coding-RNAs were obtained. Further, analysis of immediate effect of CDDP-shock showed an increase in autophagy and JNK signaling, acting as a pro-survival strategy. Regulatory connections between MAPK signaling and autophagy favoring survival under CDDP-shock was elucidated. Taken together, this is the first study portraying not only global transcriptomic alterations in resistant OS cells but also showing key molecular changes associated with CDDP-insult in OS cells. Our results can be better utilized for future therapeutic benefit."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86053GSE86101	RNA-Seq analysis of 4N and 2N RPE1 cells following polyploid induction via cytokinesis failure or Aurora kinase inhibition [tpo3]	"Tetraploidization, or genome doubling, is a prominent event in tumorigenesis, primarily because cell division in polyploid cells is error-prone and produces aneuploid cells. This study investigates changes in gene expression evoked in acute and adapted tetraploid cells and their impact on cell-cycle progression. Acute polyploidy was generated by knockdown of essential regulator of cytokinesis Anillin, which resulted in cytokinesis failure and formation of binucleate cells, or by chemical inhibition of Aurora kinases, causing abnormal mitotic exit with formation of single cells with aberrant nuclear morphology. Transcriptome analysis of these acute tetraploid cells revealed common signatures of activation of the tumor-suppressor protein p53. Suppression of proliferation in these cells was dependent on p53 and its transcriptional target - Cdk inhibitor p21. Rare proliferating tetraploid cells can emerge from acute polyploid populations. Gene expression analysis of single-cell derived, adapted tetraploid clones showed upregulation of several p53 target genes and cyclin D2, the activator of Cdk4/6/2. Overexpression of cyclin D2 in diploid cells strongly potentiated the ability to proliferate with increased DNA content despite the presence of functional p53.

Here we performed global gene expression profiling of mammary epithelial cells transformed by oncogenic v-Src, and identified a large subset of uncharacterized lncRNAs potentially involved in breast cancer development. Specifically, our analysis revealed a novel lncRNA, LINC00520 that is upregulated upon ectopic expression of oncogenic v-Src, in a manner that is dependent on the transcription factor STAT3. Similarly, LINC00520 is also increased in mammary epithelial cells transformed by oncogenic PI3K and its expression is decreased upon knockdown of mutant PIK3CA. Additional expression profiling highlight that LINC00520 is elevated in a subset of human breast carcinomas, with preferential enrichment in the basal-like molecular subtype. ShRNA-mediated depletion of LINC00520 results in decreased cell migration and loss of invasive structures in 3D. RNA sequencing analysis uncovers several genes that are differentially expressed upon ectopic expression of LINC00520, a significant subset of which are also induced in v-Src-transformed MCF10A cells. Together, these findings characterize LINC00520 as a lncRNA that is regulated by oncogenic Src, PIK3CA and STAT3, and which may contribute to the molecular etiology of breast cancer."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86159GSE86190	Effect daunorubicin treatment on the transcriptome of HCT116 cells [RNA-seq]	We used RNA-seq to measure the transcriptome of HCT116 in response to the DNA damaging agent daunorubicin	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86190GSE86202	"Analyzing the interactions of mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs to predict competing endogenous RNA networks in glioblastoma"	"Cross-talk between competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) may play a critical role in revealing potential mechanisms of tumor development and physiology. Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor, and the mechanisms of tumor genesis and development in glioblastoma are unclear. Here, to investigate the role of non-coding RNAs and the ceRNA network in glioblastoma, we performed paired-end RNA sequencing and microarray analyses to obtain the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs circRNAs and miRNAs. We identified that the expression of 501 lncRNAs, 1789 mRNAs, 2038 circRNAs and 143 miRNAs were often altered between glioblastoma and matched normal brain tissue. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed on these differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNA-mediated target genes of lncRNAs and circRNAs. Furthermore, we used a multi-step computational framework and several bioinformatics methods to construct a ceRNA network combining mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNA, based on co-expression analysis between the differentially expressed RNAs. We identified that plenty of lncRNAs, CircRNAs and their downstream target genes in the ceRNA network are related to glutamatergic synapse, suggesting that glutamate metabolism is involved in glioma biological functions. Our results will accelerate the understanding of tumorigenesis, cancer progression and even therapeutic targeting in glioblastoma.

This expansion is thought to primarily reflect differences in proliferation versus differentiation of neural progenitors during cortical development. Here, we have searched for such differences by analysing cerebral organoids from human and chimpanzees using immunohistochemistry, live imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics. We find that the cytoarchitecture, cell type composition, and neurogenic gene expression programs of humans and chimpanzees are remarkably similar. Notably, however, live imaging of apical progenitor mitosis uncovered a lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase in humans compared to chimpanzees that is specific to proliferating progenitors and not observed in non-neural cells. Consistent with this, the small set of genes more highly expressed in human apical progenitors points to increased proliferative capacity, and the proportion of neurogenic basal progenitors is lower in humans. These subtle differences in cortical progenitors between humans and chimpanzees may have consequences for human neocortex evolution."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86207GSE86308	Transcription profiling of PfSPZ Malaria Vaccine trial subjects in a malaria endemic region	The Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine can confer sterilizing protection against liver stage infection by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) in malaria nave individuals.

Oxr1 deficiency in mice resulted in cerebellar neurodegeneration. Genetic causes account for the most proportion of neurodegenerative disorders (early) onset in children. However, the pathological consequence of Oxr1 deficiency in human remains unclear. To assess the effect of OXR1 on the whole transcriptome during neuronal differentiation, we conducted RNA-sequencing of iPS cells, neural aggregates and neurons derivated from OXR1 deficient patient fibroblast and compared with healthy control. Methods: The iPS cells (iPSC) were generated from fibroblast cells of health control (WT) and OXR1 deficient patient (OX), and induced 2 days to form neural aggregate (NA) following to be differentiated into neuron cells in day 20. Total RNA was pooled from triplicate samples in each group and performed RNA sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at gene level. The GOseq program was used to generate gene ontology (GO) annotation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The pathway enrichments were identified by KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis. qRTPCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results:Totally 1595 DEGs were identified at neuron stage due to Oxr1 disruption, 874 DEGs at iPSC stage and 388 DEGs at NA stage. Among them, there are 61 DEGs commonly regulated by Oxr1 throughout all of the three stages . Further gene oncology (GO) analysis of biological process showed there was a significant enrichment for DEGs related to cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization (ECM), cell development, cell differentiation, organ development caused by Oxr1 deficiency throughout all developmental stages. Especially neurogenesis and differentiation, axonogensis and guidance, brain and nerves system development were among the top of 50 items when entering neuron stage. In addition, a set of DEGs was significantly enriched in positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway and regulation of cellular response to stress.

MYC mediates a broad transcriptional response controlling normal biological programs but its activity is not clearly understood. We address MYC function in cancer stem cells through the inducible expression of Omomyc  a MYC derived polypeptide interfering with MYC activity  taking as model the most lethal brain tumour, glioblastoma. Omomyc bridles the key cancer stem-like cell features and affects tumour microenvironment, inhibiting angiogenesis. This occurs because Omomyc interferes with proper Myc localisation and binds to DNA, with a preference for sites previously occupied by MYC. This is accompanied by (leads to) selective repression of master transcription factors for glioblastoma stem-like cell identity like POU3F2, SOX2, and OLIG2, upregulation of effectors of tumour suppression and differentiation such as PTEN, ID4, MIAT, and modulation of the expression of microRNAs that target molecules implicated in glioblastoma growth and invasion like EGFR and ZEB1. Data support a novel view of MYC as a network stabiliser that strengthens the regulatory nodes of the gene expression programs controlling cell phenotype and highlight Omomyc as model molecule for targeting cancer stem cells."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86518GSE86562	Adaptation of a RAS pathway activation signature from FF to FFPE tissues in colorectal cancer (FFPE RNA-Seq I)	"Background: The KRAS gene is mutated in about 40%% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, which has been clinically validated as a predictive mutational marker of intrinsic resistatnce to anti-EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi) therapy.

Genetic deletion of ERK5 is embryonic lethal and tissue-restricted deletions have profound effects on erythroid development, cardiac function and neurogenesis. In addition, depletion of ERK5 is anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic. Small molecule inhibition of ERK5 has been shown to have promising activity in cell and animal models of inflammation and oncology. Here we report the synthesis and biological characterization of potent, selective ERK5 inhibitors. In contrast to both genetic depletion/deletion of ERK5 and inhibition with previously reported compounds, inhibition of the kinase with the most selective of the new inhibitors had no anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative activity. The source of efficacy in previously reported ERK5 inhibitors is shown to be off-target activity on bromodomains (BRDs), conserved protein modules involved in recognition of acetyl-lysine residues during transcriptional processes. It is likely that phenotypes reported from genetic deletion or depletion of ERK5 arise from removal of a non-catalytic function of ERK5. The newly reported inhibitors should be useful in determining which of the many reported phenotypes are due to kinase activity, and delineate which can be pharmacologically targeted."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86577GSE86586	Comparative principles of DNA methylation reprogramming during human and mouse in vitro primordial germ cell specification	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86586GSE86611	"Genome-wide RNA-sequencing of human islets 48 hour after transduction with adenoviruses expressing either GFP (control), or histone chaperone ASF1B."

Most of the approaches currently under development involve transplantation of immature progenitors that subsequently undergo phenotypic and functional maturation in vivo, and predicting the long term graft outcome already at the progenitor stage remains a challenge. Here, we took an unbiased approach to identify predictive markers expressed in dopamine neuron progenitors that correlate with graft outcome in an animal model of Parkinson's disease through gene expression analysis of >30 batches of grafted hESC-derived progenitors. We found that many of the commonly-used markers did not accurately predict in vivo subtype-specific maturation. Instead, we identified a specific set of markers associated with the caudal midbrain that correlate with high dopaminergic yield after transplantation in vivo. Using these markers, we developed a GMP differentiation protocol for highly efficient and reproducible production of transplantable dopamine progenitors from hESCs."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86654GSE86813	Assessing the impact of loss of ATF7IP and SETDB1 on the transcriptome	"By comparing HeLa cells lacking ATF7IP or SETDB1 generated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption to wild-type HeLa cells, the goal of the experiment was to determine the effect of loss of the SETDB1ATF7IP complex on the transcriptome."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86813GSE86846	Global Regulation of Alternative RNA Splicing by the SR-Rich Protein RBM39	"RBM39 is extensively involved in alternative splicing of RNA and helps regulate transcript levels.

RNAseq is superior to microarray to determine DEGs because its not limited to available probes, has increased sensitivity, and detects alternative and previously unknown transcripts. DEGs were determined in adult kidney recipients, without clinical acute rejection (AR), treated with antibody induction, calcineurin inhibitor, mycophenolate, with and without steroids. Blood was obtained pre-transplant (baseline), week 1, months 3 and 6 post-transplant. PBMCs were isolated, RNA extracted and gene expression measured using RNAseq. Principal components (PCs) were computed using a surrogate variable approach. DEGs post-transplant were identified by controlling false discovery rate (FDR) at < 0.01 with at least a 2 fold change in expression from pre-transplant. The top 5 DEGs with higher levels of transcripts in blood at week 1 wereTOMM40L,TMEM205,OLFM4,MMP8, andOSBPL9compared to baseline. The top 5 DEGs with lower levels at week 1 post-transplant wereIL7R,KLRC3,CD3E,CD3D, andKLRC2(Striking Image) compared to baseline. The top pathways from genes with lower levels at 1 week post-transplant compared to baseline, were T cell receptor signaling and iCOS-iCOSL signaling while the top pathways from genes with higher levels than baseline were axonal guidance signaling and LXR/RXR activation. Gene expression signatures at month 3 were similar to week 1. DEGs at 6 months post-transplant create a different gene signature than week 1 or month 3 post-transplant. RNAseq analysis identified more DEGs with lower than higher levels in blood compared to baseline at week 1 and month 3. The number of DEGs decreased with time post-transplant. Further investigations to determine the specific lymphocyte(s) responsible for differential gene expression may be important in selecting and personalizing immune suppressant drugs and may lead to targeted therapies."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86884GSE86894	REGION-SPECIFIC NEURAL STEM CELL LINEAGES REVEALED BY SINGLE-CELL RNA-SEQ FROM HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS	This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86894GSE86931	Exercise-induced transcriptome changes in skeletal muscle adapted to aerobic training	We sequenced mRNA in vastus lateralis muscle samples from two amateur endurance-trained men (V 2max 57 ml/min/kg) before and after acute endurance exercise	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86931GSE86940	Histone modification and RNA changes in macrophages exposed to Beta-glucan and Fumarate	"Innate immune memory is the phenomenon whereby innate immune cells such as monocytes or macrophages undergo functional reprogramming after exposure to microbial components such as Beta glucan.

We found that the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) of primed hESCs was reactivated in nave culture conditions. Similar to cells of the blastocyst, resulting naive cells exhibited two active X-chromosomes with XIST expression and chromosome-wide transcriptional dampening, and initiated XIST-mediated X-inactivation upon differentiation. Both establishment and exit from the nave state (differentiation) happened via an XIST-negative XaXa intermediate. Together, these findings identify a cell culture system for functionally exploring the two X-chromosome dosage compensation processes in early human development: X-dampening and X-inactivation. Furthermore, the nave state reset Xi abnormalities of primed hESCs, providing cells better suited for downstream applications. However, nave hESCs displayed differences to the embryo because XIST expression was predominantly mono-allelic instead of bi-allelic, and X-inactivation was non-random, indicating the need for further culture improvement."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87231GSE87240	S-adenosyl-methionine treatment selectively block liver cancer cell lines transformation and invasiveness by alterations of cancer- and invasion specific transcriptome and methylome (RNA-Seq)	"S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is a ubiquitous methyl donor that was reported to have chemo- protective activity against liver cancer, however the molecular footprint of SAM has been unknown. We show here that SAM selectively inhibits growth, transformation and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines but not normal primary liver cells. Analysis of the transcriptome of SAM treated and untreated cancer cell lines HepG2 and SKHep1 and primary liver cells reveals pathways involved in cancer and metastasis that are upregulated in cancer cells and silenced by SAM. Analysis of the methylome using bisulfite mapping of captured promoters and enhancers reveals that SAM hyper-methylates and silences genes in pathways of growth and metastasis that are activated in liver cancer cells. Depletion of two SAM silencing targets similarly reduces cellular transformation and invasiveness.

We hypothesized that mRNA and lincRNA expression is modulated in disease-relevant tissues in humans in vivo during inflammation, and differs between individuals with divergent evoked inflammatory responses. In the Genetics of Evoked Response to Niacin and Endotoxemia (GENE) Study, we performed an inpatient endotoxin challenge (1ng/kg LPS) in healthy humans. We selected individuals in the top (high-responders) and bottom (low-responders) extremes for inflammatory responses, and applied RNASeq to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, n=15) before and after LPS administration. At baseline, there were limited differences in gene expression by sex or race. Further, only a small number of genes differed between high and low responders at baseline. Post-LPS, there were clear differences in the magnitude of the transcriptional response between high and low responders, with a far greater number of genes differentially expressed post-LPS in high responders, consistent with the clinical response. We also found a number of differentially expressed long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) post-LPS. We show that differences in gene expression may drive differences in clinical inflammatory response, and that differentially expressed genes and lincRNAs represent novel candidates for modulation of immune and metabolic responses in acute and chronic diseases."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87290GSE87307	Gene and microRNA expression changes induced by overexpression of SphK1 in papillary thyroid cancer cells [RNA-seq]	"The oncogenic roles of Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in various cancers, including thyroid cancer, have been well demonstrated. However, miRNAs associated with the oncogenic roles of SphK1 remains largely unknown. The goal of this study is to detect the global gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression in response to Sphk1 over-expression and identify potential therapeutic targets. To achieve this, SphK1 was stably overexpressed in papillary thyroid cancer cell line TPC1. Then the mRNA and miRNA expression were quantified using digitalgeneexpression(DGE) analysis and small RNA-seq in TPC1-Vector and TPC1-SphK1 cells, respectively. miRNA-mRNA interactions were explored by microT-CDS and the predicted networks were visualized using CytoScape. In this study, we found thatover-expression of SphK1 differentially regulates 46 miRNAs and 506 mRNAs expression in TPC1 cells. Combining bioinformatics prediction of mRNA targets and DGE data on mRNA expressions allowed to identify mRNA targets of deregulated miRNAs. The direct interaction between miR-144-3p and FN1 mRNA, which mediates the pro-invasive role of SphK1 in thyroid cancer cells, was experimentally validated. In general, our results provided a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in response to SphK1 overexpression in thyroid cancer cells. We also demonstrated a role of miR-144-3p and FN1 in mediating oncogenic function of SphK1, which enhance the understanding of etiology of thyroid cancer."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87307GSE87340	Conserved recurrent gene mutations correlate with pathway deregulation and clinical outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma in never-smokers	"Background. Novel and targetable mutations are needed for improved understanding and treatment of lung cancer in never-smokers. Methods. Twenty-seven lung adenocarcinomas from never-smokers were sequenced by both exome and mRNA-seq with respective normal tissues. Somatic mutations were detected and compared with pathway deregulation, tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Results. Although somatic mutations in DNA or mRNA ranged from hundreds to thousands in each tumor, the overlap mutations between the two were only a few to a couple of hundreds. The number of somatic mutations from either DNA or mRNA was not significantly associated with clinical variables; however, the number of overlap mutations was associated with cancer subtype. These overlap mutants were preferentially expressed in mRNA with consistently higher allele frequency in mRNA than in DNA. Ten genes (EGFR, TP53, KRAS, RPS6KB2, ATXN2, DHX9, PTPN13, SP1, SPTAN1 and MYOF) had recurrent mutations and these mutations were highly correlated with pathway deregulation and patient survival. Conclusions. The recurrent mutations present in both DNA and RNA are likely the driver for tumor biology, pathway deregulation and clinical outcomes.

However, it is often difficult to detect the subtle effects of n-3 PUFA on inflammatory biomarkers in traditional intervention studies. We aimed to identify novel n-3 PUFA modulated gene expression using unbiased adipose transcriptomics during evoked endotoxemia in a clinical trial of n-3 PUFA supplementation. We analyzed adipose gene expression using RNA sequencing in the fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty acid modulation of endotoxemia (FFAME) trial of healthy individuals at three timepoints: before and after n-3 PUFA supplementation (n=8; 3600mg/day EPA/DHA) for 6weeks compared with placebo (n=6), as well as during a subsequent evoked inflammatory challenge (lipopolysaccharide 0.6ng/kg i.v.). As expected, supplementation with n-3 PUFA vs. placebo alone had only modest effects on adipose tissue gene expression. In contrast, the transcriptomic response to evoked endotoxemia was significantly modified by n-3 PUFA supplementation, with several genes demonstrating significant n-3 PUFA gene-nutrient interactions. These data highlight potential mechanisms whereby n-3 PUFA consumption may enhance the immune response to an inflammatory challenge."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87426GSE87487	Genes encoding cognate receptors for IRI-related recipient cytokines are expressed in donor livers	"Purpose: RNAseq was used to look in donor allografts for genes encoding cytokine receptors specific to the cytokines identified to be upregulated in the blood of Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) receipients with ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) Methods: Liver mRNA cytokine receptor profiles of allografts taken before and after transplant, demultiplexed with Illumina CASAVA, trimmed with Cutadapt, aligned to hg38 with STAR, counted with featureCounts Results: We identified expression of genes encoding 10 cognate receptors for the 14 potential cytokines found to be upregulated in IRI+ patients.

DUX4 is a transcription factor that activates genes normally associated with stem cell biology and its mis-expression in FSHD cells results in apoptosis. To identify genes and pathways necessary for DUX4-mediated apoptosis, we performed an siRNA screen in an RD rhabdomyosarcoma cell line with an inducible DUX4 transgene. Our screen identified components of the MYC-mediated apoptotic pathway and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) innate immune response pathway as mediators of DUX4-induced apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that DUX4 expression led to increased MYC mRNA, accumulation of nuclear dsRNA foci, and activation of the dsRNA response pathway in both RD cells and human myoblasts. Nuclear dsRNA foci were associated with aggregation of the exon junction complex component EIF4A3. The elevation of MYC mRNA, dsRNA accumulation, and EIF4A3 nuclear aggregates in FSHD muscle cells suggest that these processes might contribute to FSHD pathophysiology."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87495GSE87497	Evaluating Side Effects of Nanoparticle-mediated siRNA Delivery to Mesenchymal Stem Cells Using Next-generation Sequencing and Enrichment Analysis	"RNA interference (RNAi) has immense potential to modulate cell functions. However, effective delivery of siRNA while avoiding deleterious side effects has proven challenging. This study investigates both intended and unintended effects of diblock copolymer nanoparticle (NP) delivery of siRNA delivery to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). Specifically, siRNA delivery was investigated at a range of NP-siRNA:hMSC ratios with a focus on the effects of NP-siRNA treatment on hMSC functions. Additionally, next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used with enrichment analysis to observe side effects in hMSC gene expression. Results show NP-siRNA delivery is negatively correlated with hMSC density. However, higher NP-siRNA:hMSC ratios increased cytotoxicity and decreased metabolic activity. hMSC proliferation was largely unaffected by NP-siRNA treatment, except for a 3-fold reduction in hMSCs seeded at 4,000 cells/cm2. Flow cytometry reveals that apoptosis is a function of NP-siRNA treatment time and seeding density; ~14%% of the treated hMSCs seeded at 8,000 cells/cm2 were annexin V+-siRNA+ 24 h after treatment, while 11%% of the treated population was annexin V+-siRNA-. RNA-seq shows that NP-siRNA treatment results in transcriptomic changes in hMSCs, while pathway analysis shows upregulation of apoptosis signaling and downregulation of metabolism, cell cycle, and DNA replication pathways, as corroborated by apoptosis, metabolism, and proliferation assays. Additionally, multiple innate immune signaling pathways such as toll-like receptor (TLR), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptor, and nuclear factor-B (NF-B) signaling pathways are upregulated. Furthermore, and consistent with traditional siRNA immune activation, cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling was also upregulated. Overall, this study provides insight into NP-siRNA:hMSC ratios that are favorable for siRNA delivery. Moreover, NP-siRNA delivery results in side effects across the MSC transcriptome that suggest activation of the innate immunity that could alter MSC functions associated with their therapeutic potential."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87497GSE87641	Adaptive resistance of melanoma cells to RAF inhibition via reversible induction of a slowly-dividing de-differentiated state	"Treatment of BRAF-mutant melanomas with MAP-kinase pathway inhibitors is paradigmatic of the promise of precision cancer therapy but also highlights problems with drug resistance that limit patient benefit. We use live-cell imaging, single-cell analysis and molecular profiling to show that exposure of tumor cells to RAF/MEK inhibitors elicits a heterogeneous response in which some cells die, some arrest and a remaining fraction adapts to drug. Drug-adapted cells up-regulate markers of the neural crest (e.g. NGFR), a melanocyte precursor, and grow slowly. To identify genes associated with acquisition of the slowly-cycling, vemurafenib-adapted state, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on COLO858 cells (that show the slowly-cycling phenotype) exposed to drug for 24 and 48 h; drug-treated MMACSF cells served as a control.

We report that p53 activation enhances the processivity of DNA replication, as monitored by multi-label fiber assays, whereas removal of p53 reduces fork progression. This was observed in tumor-derived U2OS cells, but also in murine embryonic fibroblasts with heterozygous or homozygous p53 deletion, and in freshly isolated thymocytes from mice with differential p53 status. Mdm2, a p53-inducible gene product, similarly supported DNA replication even in p53-deficient cells, suggesting that sustained Mdm2-expression is at least one of the mechanisms allowing p53 to prevent replicative stress. Thus, p53 helps to protect the genome during S phase, by preventing the occurrence of stalled or collapsed replication forks. These results expand p53s tumor-suppressive functions, adding to the ex-post model (elimination of damaged cells) an ex-ante activity, i.e. the prevention of DNA damage during replication."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87668GSE87710	Systematic Functional Dissection of Common Genetic Variation Affecting Red Blood Cell Traits [mRNA-Seq]	"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of associations between common genetic variants and human disease phenotypes, but the majority of these variants are non-coding, often requiring genetic fine-mapping, epigenomic profiling, and individual reporter assays to delineate potential causal variants. We employ a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to simultaneously screen 2,756 variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with 75 sentinel variants associated with red blood cell traits. We show that this assay identifies elements with endogenous erythroid regulatory activity. Across 23 sentinel variants, we conservatively identified 32 MPRA functional variants (MFVs). We used targeted genome editing to demonstrate endogenous enhancer activity across 3 MFVs that predominantly affect the transcription of SMIM1, RBM38, and CD164. Functional follow-up of RBM38 delineates a key role for this gene in the alternative splicing program occurring during terminal erythropoiesis.

Herein, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) on 7 CDC samples (CDC1 -7). Among the 7 samples, 4 samples with matched non-tumor tissue were used for copy number analysis by SNP array data. No recurrent somatic SNVs were observed except for MLL, which was found to be mutated (p.V297I and p.F407C) in 2 samples. We identified somatic SNVs in 14 other cancer census genes including: ATM, CREBBP, PRDM1, CBFB, FBXW7, IKZF1, KDR, KRAS, NACA, NF2, NUP98, SS18, TP53, and ZNF521. SNP array data identified a CDKN2A homozygous deletion in 3 samples and SNV analysis showed a non-sense mutation of the CDKN2A gene with unknown somatic status. To estimate the recurrent rate of CDKN2A abnormalities, we performed FISH screening of additional samples and confirmed the frequent loss (62.5%%) of CDKN2A expression. Since cisplatin based therapy is the common treatment option for CDC, we investigated the expression of solute carrier (SLC) family transporters and found 45%% alteration. In addition, SLC7A11 (cystine transporter, xCT), a cisplatin resistance associated gene, was found to be overexpressed in 4 out of 5 (80%%) cases of CDC tumors tested, as compared to matched non-tumor tissue.

Then we made a genome-scale ATF library and tested it in reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Three combinations of ATFs (C2, C3, and C4) could induce pluripotency when expressed with Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. We harvested polyadenylated RNAs from 11 cell types derived with different sets of factors. The transcriptional profiles of ATF-induced iPS cells are similar to that of iPS cells induced with Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc and mouse embryonic stem cells, exhibiting up-regulation of pluripotency markers and down-regulation of fibroblast markers. Comparisons of cells undergoing reprogramming at an intermediate stage before becoming fully reprogrammed suggest that ATFs activate a different set of genes than the set activated by Oct4.

Current approaches to evaluate the efficiency of stimuli activating immune cells are mainly defined by known flow cytometry-based cell activation or cell maturation markers. This method however does not give a complete overview of the achieved activation state and may leave important side effects unnoticed. Here, we used an unbiased RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based approach to compare the capacity of four clinical-grade dendritic cell (DC) activation stimuli used to prepare DC-vaccines composed of various types of DC subsets; the already clinically applied GM-CSF and Frhsommer meningoencephalitis (FSME) prophylactic vaccine and the novel clinical grade adjuvants protamine-RNA (pRNA) complexes and CpG-P. We found that GM-CSF and pRNA have similar effects on their target cells, whereas pRNA and CpG-P induce stronger tType I interferon (IFN) expression than FSME. In general, the pathways most affected by all stimuli were related to immune activity and cell migration. GM-CSF stimulation, however, also induced a significant increase of genes related to nonsense-mediated decay, indicating a possible deleterious effect of this stimulus. Taken together, all novel stimuli appear to be promising alternatives. Our study demonstrates how RNA-seq based investigation of changes in a large number of genes and gene groups can be exploited for fast and unbiased, global evaluation of clinical-grade stimuli, as opposed to the general limited evaluation of a pre-specified set of genes, by which one might miss important biological effects detrimental for vaccine efficacy."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89442GSE89446	Low H3K27me3 and DNA hypomethylation define poorly prognostic pediatric posterior fossa ependymomas	"A subgroup of Posterior fossa ependymomas show reduced H3K27me3, global DNA hypomethylation, are more invasive, exhibit poor prognosis and epigenetically deregulated genes converge on radial glial factors, suggesting developing cerebellar radial glia as candidate cells-of-origin."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89446GSE89479	Self-organized amniogenesis by human pluripotent stem cells in a biomimetic implantation-like niche	"In this work, we generated early human amnion-like tissues by culturing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a bioengineered implantation-like niche in vitro.

Data analysis from a myeloma patient database shows that the CD28-CD86 signaling module may provide a survival advantage in myeloma cells that negatively impacts patient outcome. Here we show that blocking the CD28-CD86 pathway, by silencing or with CTLA-4-Ig, leads to myeloma cell death. Blockade of this pathway leads to downregulation of nutrient transporters, integrins, and IRF4, a known myeloma survival factor. Our data also indicate that CD86, the canonical 'ligand' in this pathway, is mediating a pro-survival signal via the cytosolic domain that has not been previously described. These findings indicate that blockade of this pathway is a promising therapeutic avenue for myeloma, as it leads to modulation of different processes important in cell viability."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89511GSE89714	Differential gene expressions in the heart of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients	"Differential gene expressions were constructed through expression profiling of a total of 20,127 genes in the heart tissue of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, then 1799 significant differential genes were filtered based on the criteria (p<0.05 and fold change > 1.5), respectively."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89714GSE89729	Quantitative Analysis of PPARD Transcriptomes in Colon Cancer Cells by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)	"Purpose: NGS has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cell signaling pathways. The goal of this study is to determine the effects of PPARD in colon cancer cell transcriptomes in relation to the metastatic potential. Methods: NGS-derived colon cancer cell mRNA transcriptome profiles of HCT116 WT (HCT116) and HCT116 with genetic PPARD-knockout (KO1) cells were generated by deep sequencing, in quadruplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000 .The transcriptomes of HCT116 and KO1 cells will be compared to determine the differentially expressed genes between HCT116 and KO1 cells. Differentially expressed genes will be examined in relation to the metastatic potential and validated by qRT-PCR. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow Tophat2, we mapped about 25 million sequence reads per sample to the human genome. Out of 22229 genes, we identified 12118 transcripts with >50 reads in at least one sample of HCT116 and KO1 cells with edgeR package and identified 6668 differentailly expressed genes with FDR 0.001 and P value cutoff 0.0022 using GLM tests fitted with BUM model. We further fltered the genes with both p-value and fold change and identified 416 genes with FDR 0.001 and fold change larger than 2. Among the differentially expressed genes, 311 were downregulated and 105 were upregulated in the KO1 cells compared with the WT cells. Twenty-three of the differentially expressed genes had significant association (i.e., a tendency towards co-occurrence) with PPARD expression (P < 0.05; log odds ratio > 1.5) in the TCGA colorectal adenocarcinoma database. Of these 23 genes, 7 were linked to metastasis by PubMed literature searches: GJA1, VIM, SPARC, NRG1, CXCL8 (IL-8), STC1, and SNCG, which were validated by q-RT-PCR. Conclusions: Our study represents the detailed analysis of PPARD transcriptomes in colon cancer cells, generated by mRNA-seq technology. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluations of mRNA contents in cells.

Here we investigate the use of iPSCs and iPSC-derived cells to study the impact of genetic variation across different cell types and as models for the genetics of complex disease. We established a panel of iPSCs from 58 well-studied Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs); 14 of these lines were further differentiated into cardiomyocytes. We characterized regulatory variation across individuals and cell types by measuring RNA, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. Regulatory variation between individuals is lower in iPSCs than in the differentiated cell types, consistent with the intuition that developmental processes are generally canalized. While most cell-type- specific regulatory effects lie in chromatin that is open only in the affected cell-types, we find that 20%% of cell-type specific effects are in shared open chromatin. Finally, we developed deep neural network models to predict open chromatin regions in these cell types from DNA sequence alone and were able to use the sequences of segregating haplotypes to predict the effects of common SNPs on tissue-specific chromatin accessibility. Our results provide a framework for using iPSC technology to study regulatory variation in cell types that are otherwise inaccessible."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89895GSE89926	Exosomal short RNA sequencing experiments	"The characterization of extracellular vesicular RNA (EV RNA) derived from nine cell types demonstrated the diversity of cell type specific RNA biotypes.

In addition, the study highlights both the temporal dynamics and spatial localization of intact EV RNA after transfer into a recipient cell, and their ability to elicit a wide range of transcriptional changes within them. We also demonstrated the cell type specificity in response from two different cell types, when exposed to the same EV RNA stimuli, underscoring the context dependent interpretation of the complex EV RNA message.

Five missense, two nonsense, one 9-bp duplication, and one splice-site variant in EBF3 were found; the mutation occurred de novo in eight individuals, and the missense variant c.625C>T [p.(Arg209Trp)] was inherited by two affected siblings from their healthy mother who is a mosaic. EBF3 belongs to the early B-cell factor family (also known as Olf, COE, or O/E) and encodes a transcription factor involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation. Structural assessment predicts damaging effects of the five amino acid substitutions on DNA-binding of EBF3. Transient expression of EBF3 mutant proteins in HEK 293T cells revealed mislocalization of all but one mutant in the cytoplasm in addition to nuclear localization. By transactivation assays, all EBF3 mutants showed significantly reduced or no ability to activate transcription of the CDKN1A reporter gene, and EBF3 mutant proteins were less tightly associated with chromatin as demonstrated by in situ subcellular fractionation experiments. Finally, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments demonstrate that EBF3 acts as a transcriptional regulator and EBF3 mutant protein had reduced genome-wide DNA binding and gene regulatory activity. Our findings demonstrate that variants that disrupt EBF3-mediated transcriptional regulation cause intellectual disability and developmental delay, and are present in ~0.1%% of individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE90682GSE90796	RNA-sequencing of human intestinal enteroids infected with or without human rotavirus (strain Ito)	We report the human intestinal epithelial host transcriptional response to human enteric virus infection using primary human intestinal enteroids cultures as a model system.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE90796GSE90851	Predominant TRUB1-dependent pseudouridylation of mammalian mRNA via a predictable and conserved code	"In this accession we provide pseudouridylation measurements upon knockdown and/or overexpression three pseudouridine synthases, two of which (TRUB1 and PUS7) we find to be with predominant activity on mammalian mRNA."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE90851GSE91016	Global transcriptional profiling changes upon knockdown of LKB1 in human glioblastoma cell lines	"The experiment was designed to display differential gene expression profiling changes in two human glioblastoma cells upon knockdow of LKB1 tumor suppressor, by using RNAseq technology."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE91016GSE92574	Mapping of DHT-responsive or -independent AR-binding sites induced by activated Src in prostate cancer cell lines [RNA-seq]	"Building on the observation that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) correlates with activation of Src-family tyrosine kinases, we showed that the expression of activated Src renders LNCaP androgen-independent. Here, we report on RNA-seq and/or AR ChIP-seq analyses of LNCaP, LNCaP[Src], VCaP, 22Rv1 cells grown in the presence or absence of 10 nM DHT for 16h, or LuCaP35.1 tumors grown in androgen-supplemented vs. castrated mice (androgen-dependent vs. castration-resistant).

The biological roles of RNAPII pausing release and the mechanisms that by which extracellular signals control it are incompletely understood. Here we identify a novel mechanism by which VEGF stimulates RNAPII pausing-release through acetylation of ETS1, a master endothelial cell transcriptional regulator. In endothelial cells (ECs), ETS1 uniquely bound transcribed gene promoters and stimulated their expression by broadly increasing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) pause release. VEGF enhanced ETS1 chromatin occupancy. Furthermore, VEGF increased ETS1 acetylation, enhancing its binding by BRD4 and thereby stimulating RNAPII pause release. This ETS1-mediated transduction of VEGF signaling to increase RNAPII pausing release was essential for EC angiogenic responses in vitro and in vivo. Together, our results define a new angiogenic pathway in which VEGF enhances ETS1-Brd4 interaction to broadly promote RNAPII pause release and drive angiogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE93030GSE93057	RNAseq analysis of patient-derived luminal breast cancer xenografts treated with progestins	Primary breast cancer xenografts	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE93057GSE93263	Incomplete MyoD-induced transdifferentiation is mediated by chromatin remodeling deficiencies [RNA-Seq]	"MyoD is known to transdifferentiate fibroblasts into muscle-like cells. Despite phenotypic resemblance and expression of myogenic marker genes in transdifferentiated cells, our global gene expression data suggests that ~100 genes, many involved in muscle development and function, remain non-reprogrammed. To understand this incomplete reprogramming, we characterized genome-wide chromatin accessibility and MyoD binding in human primary myoblasts and in MyoD-induced skin fibroblast cells. Our analyses revealed thousands of sites with incomplete chromatin reprogramming.Combined analyses of gene expression and epigenetic profiles revealed that many myogenic genes not upregulated during the transdifferentiation process have undergone MyoD-dependent chromatin remodeling, but to a significantly lower extent than reprogrammed genes. Our findings suggest that incomplete MyoD-induced transdifferentiation is due to chromatin-remodeling deficiencies, and that additional factors are required to transdifferentiate cells into a state more similar to myoblasts."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE93263GSE93280	Long noncoding RNAs transcribed by ERV-9 LTR retrotransposon act in cis to modulate long-range LTR enhancer function [RNA-Seq]	"LTR retrotransposons are repetitive DNA elements comprising ~10%% of the human genome.

Global knock-down of ERV-LTR lncRNAs was performed in the in vitro erythropoiesis system of human CD34 cells, and genome wide RNA-seq was carried out to detect the effect on transcription."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE93280
